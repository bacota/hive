 those are things that you pay quite a bit of money for. So its nice to have that extra help or extended warranty in case something happens.You just never know. And I havent really used it for anything cause theyre both fairly new.

 For the iPhone and the iPad that I have and I can say that in probably in the last
 18 months Ive used the Apple care to replace the product twice that I know of for accidental damage.
 And that is covered. I dont purchase extended warranties on anything else. Sometimes I find that the price of the extended warrantyfor example, on a TV that I bought last year cost about a third the extended warranty cost a third of what the
 Actual TV does and the price of TVs has come down so much that I just dont think itsfinancially, a good decision to make. As far as where I keep the warranties. Im in the file cabinet.
 Which is over here.
 Where is it? Do it this way. Anyway it is in a file cabinet that Im looking at right now? Which is a simple file cabinet. I have under warranties.

 Where the game requires a new update so we uninstall the program several times weve reinstalled it and it does reinstall.
 But when you try to unstick install the update the update causes the game to not launch again. So weve been back and forth.

 FIFA 18 is using in my information, which I thought was a bunch of crap because theres no issue with

Samsung is certainly made some.Big strides and you know picture quality and other things, and these are things that I look very.Carefully at but the first thing I would do here is go here and and review what the new iPhone is capable of I would.Definitely go here and watch.The videos I think 10 media disguised al vision for the future news or things that today in the picture quality or other things.You know try to avoid the Fluff and get down to really you know what is it?

Can you make it can you make a nice feeling wanted to?What is this quality is slow motion light with the quality polety of the picture you know how long can you record?You know those types of things and then you know what is its compatibility with editing software and so forth so I look at all of those things and then after that.I will definitely go and all type in Apple.IPhone versusSamsung.In particular that you know the latest dinner.The latest versions Arthur Apple.10 Samsung Galaxy and here is a comparison here and Ill redo that comparison and look at the face off try to find sites that.Are.You know respectable sites.Ones that dive Ive heard of before you know, Zdnet CRN word of those both trusted reviews.Which would you pick you know C net user?

Ive had you know several of them over the years and lately every time I call with the problem.You know, I dont give an application number back last. I heard like I said II dont think I have an apple care policy. I think my last one ended in 2014.But when I call primarily its usually I was a little something to do with the phone. But more often something to do with my pro app their final cut pro.App now on my computer, which is my computers. You know like a 2009 still running. Im even editing 4 K.Videos on it.And when I have a problem. I call up. I dont have to wait very long in the phone usually.Very rarely and when I get somebody I can make speak you know good English. I can understand them.And they really know their stuff and I always figure out a problem getting answers to you know how to do.Something I know there nots supposed to be so much a you know a tutoring place. But you know theyve been just exceptionally good to me if I had something that.You know, I thought youre supposed to be able to do with it, you know, I just found some kind of problem or obstacle.And I just didnt have time to go through a lot of research online or I tried little bit of research and couldnt find anything really solid.With respect to you know, an answer Ive been awake call them up, get one of those programs on the phone and you know a few minutes later.Were done, you know, Ive got the answer.

You cant find contact for a title that really deals with the issue youre having.And they just put this giant brick wall up between you and any human beings and I really despise that I think its.You know, fortunately for them, theyve gotta be so huge they can get away with just horrible horrible customer service.But.You know, I see how it can be done with Apple and also a huge company and they provide you know, fantastic customer service so.Thats that s a big factor for me well.

 As far as the cost, I would have to have a detailed comparison. I would want to know if it covers everything the other warranty does and a clear understanding of the comparative benefits.
 
 My concern would be the those who I would have to go to for help were not as knowledgeable of the product as the manufacturer of that product. The term “third party” always seems to mean “inferior.” Overcoming that would be important.",,,,,

 Again, I think anyone offering third party warranties or extended care, should look at what Apple does.

This is my last submission.I believe that Mr. Sub Missionin today Im going to talk about.Tech frustration here for a second.I would tell you we have a small business.Ive met her several times and we use,Quickbooks 2. Run our business.And a few years ago we decided it was best to put our quickbooks in the cloud.So we pay we log into a server thats in once in California think ones in Jersey or somewhere.Stores are data force in the reason we did that was.Because we had a computer go out which was our main.Computer for accounting and hard drives quit and we had to go back and re create a bunch of stuff and.It wasnt. A good situation for any business to be in.So what we did was we moved to silver account until we moved our quickbooks into the cloud and now we dont buy the hard copy of Quickbooks.We pay the People that store the information they keep Quickbooks up today and we just pay them a ******* fee and.Thats good except. Arziani can see onmy screen. That is Quickbooks online tuner.Im logged in right now on my laptop,but one of the frustrations with this.You dont have no control when the updates happen.The updates are installed wrong.You cant log in. Ive Caesars up on you have to contact technical support and then fix it.So there are times when it can be very frustrating.You dont have control over whats going on with your?Quickbooks will use it daily to place orders received payments to invoices to you know bill parts and the whole thing.So thats pretty frustrating and.The frustration probably doesnt outweigh the convenience of having a backed up,and secured in the location.You know if our house burned down.We still log in somewhere.Any laptop we could log into.And go back to work if we needed to so thats security reasons is good with the frustration is not having any control over what you?What you do or how its operating functions always have to put in a work order ticket and you have no idea when they going to get to you.So that be the frustration set a technology thanks.Bye.",Quickbooks in the cloud.," You bet, thank you!",,,,,

Im only looking at TVs that I would buy something 60 inches above.So the last TV, I was told that with this Samsung Premium No. I wont buy it too much.I think the price of them is too much to add that ones out, but they have a couple other over here, Id like to look at.This is a Samsung premium this is 82 inch TV 4 K, which I like the 8000 series.So I see 8000 series, just in different sizes. Thats one thing Ive noticed and has a game mode.Which I dont care about?Heres the TV Im talking about you can see it right there. Its on the TV they got a basketball game on there right now.But it certified UHD? What does certified mean arent all of my certified this is 4 K?Ultra connect.Smart voice I guess this is something new, kysa that I earlier one remote and voices system so that goes back to the thing at these some of the stuff I never dreamed it.Can I bite the last TV about her downstairs about a year ago. I dont think this other stuff is out?So this is a one remote detects control you connected gearing connect so I guess anything connected to it. This picks it up.He wrote your remote control picks, it up so you can operate maybe your sound bar.I dont know what I should hook up to it, but I do like one of the things I liked it.I like something simple I want to be able to, if I want to watch Netflix or Amazon. I like my remote controller have that on there.I can connect my TV my TV to the remote or to the Internet. I hit my DirecTV but not DirecTV.I do have DirecTV but I hit my remote for the TV set the Amazon Button, now its.I can goats can t a scroll. Amazon and find out what they have which I enjoy it like so anyways.This TV $3000 its on sale for 3200 but its on sale for 32009 or 79.Probably more than I would spend for the TV so that ones out, Nope Nope, not for me. We gotta couple more here.Heres and 75 inch 4 K TV. It is a also a Samsung and its 1679 but it s a 7.1000 Series, but it doesn for Loop 75 inch 7000 series clean cable solution so youve never heard that before.So tells me neatly manage chords and Chris Clean. Look, I probably pay for that because this was standard.I already have, I just use some zip ties zip tie my court together and ban him out of the way.So this TV is what is it this one is 80 inches and its 3000 this ones 75 inches.And 1515, 79 right now, so this was definitely in my threshold of buying Im not spending.$3000 on a TV not yet not right now, so I do like the Samsung TV and I have a hard time the scribing or determining.Which ones better Samsung Vizio Sony Petachi to shiba you just dont know I hear someone that I would buy?When I first glance it s a LG 65 inch 4 K Smart TV there, it is the box.So I would say about this TV is, is Stephanie. My threshold price range right now 88,200 or 8.$1829 left in my threshold 2018 its 10 Scott, 4, K and it has some features I never know about.Why color gamut whatever that means color reproductions even closer to cinnamon quality but again it goes down to my eyes my eyes arent even that.You know that TV looks great matter fact, everyone of these TVs, I think the colors, gray dinner.So anyway that is a good TV. I probably buy it and they got one morning and capture that all cover.And Ill wrap this up here is a Samsung 65 inch 4 K.7000 Series, I think I just saw that this is certified whatever UHD means its focus is 4 K.Ultra HD connected Smart TV has a motion rate, which I dont know anything about and I dont really care about.Clean cable solution again set must be a Samsung thing again my threshold would be, I would buy this TV.829 Bucks 65 inch at what I have hanging in my Lumina, 65 inch.And it was a 4 K about a couple years ago and they first come out on Christmas Eve.It was snowing there having a special.And I stood in line to buy it at first time and only time I ever done that. But I did save like 1000 bucks.Please let me believe that and one thing I like about do you like about Sams club these big box stores?They offer this for your protection and its fairly cheap. I would probably do it, I would do it.129 Bucks for 4 years and I think theyre pretty good about replacing the product and I wouldnt do it directly with that.Do you wouldnt take no extended warranty from a dealer theres always said they know it breaks and it breaks after the warranty.Anyways I think thats about my store in our stick to it, but thank you for allowing me to take part in your?Youre electronic search, I guess I dont know what the whole thing is for Ive never did figure that out.Thank you and Ill submit these videos of call of the day and by.",Part 2 tv upgrade, I’m not really a fan of third party warranties. In the past I purchased a third party warranty for my home appliances and when I went to use it they denied my claim. I purchased an extended warranty for a new Toyota pickup and when I went to use it they did not cover the part or labor. I’m not sure electronics would be any different so I avoid them.

He just go through I do see some of that I would probably buy and the first one, I look at right here is.TV and it is a LG and when I look at this when I look at the LG TV.It looks like its something new. They call it oh LEDTV so I dont know anything about that.I probably want to study up with that is to find out what thats about it looks to me like just read the bullets. It s a?Official intelligence voice control did become the Center for your connected smart devices. Well, thats kind of interesting. Maybe more than I would need so I dont know if I want to pay for it.Because the price of this TV. It is a 4 K, which is nice but the price is $3449.But its $500 off right now, said 65 inch 4, ** HD TV smart, so its the premium version.And its its definitely got a great great picture and has a intellect processor. LGs most powerful process provides true life images with rich colors represent death.Some that doesnt mean anything I think my eyes are I work glasses. So my eyes are probably only be good to her.4 K anyhow beyond that, I dont know if I get any help.I like the size.Do you like LG products my refrigerators, LG?And my washer and dryer LG.So I think its probably a good TV, but out of my price range. One is Scott more than I need.And I wouldnt spend the extra money when I can go right over here to the next TV set.Get LG TV U HD TV 70 inch 4, ** HD TV Smart TV.So this is the TV Im talking about now you can see it here.See the price ******* its 1500 hours less without being on sale.Its 70 inches, 5 inches bigger and its seasoning new but this TV, too thin. I like the thin TVs.I have my hanging on the wall, the one in the house that 70 inch is would be for downstairs.Because the wall this would dominate the wall that the TVs are so I do like LG TVs.I do like it, its HDTV or that its 4 K even though I never watched him for kids only very few shows in 4 K.Tarda find official 4 K so that might be a reason not to buy it. But just in case all those things come all the TV shows and movies.Come to 4 KI want to have it.And here is a vizio TV I have a vizio downstairs. It s a smart TV this here is a.70 inch 4 K Smart TV D series, they have all these series thats when they dont like about.When you shop you see a vizio 70 inch smart TV and theres like 5 versions of it.Or tell me they give me all this, I want to know exactly what the differences are.Chromecast built-in thats what the TV downstairs has and I dont even know what it is, and not probably wont take the time to use itcause I wont.I just havent had time and so this TV is a nice TV. I would buy it because the prices.$789. Its in my price range. You feel you know, there s a threshold you have for certain items.The TVs to spend more on that now its how you have to give me some good differentiators.For the differentiators of your TV to make it better than other one, not going to pay $2000 more for it.Paramed another TV I love that color of it to Samsung. Its 75 inch 4 K 8000 Series Smart TV.There it is so the question is, is that TV worth $1000 more than the one I just saw.Probably not I look at it.Has it says as dynamic color olive and say that this windes say his game mode. I wouldnt buy a game mode TVcause. I dont play games, no video games.Has one remote well, I thought all TV said one remote so there must be something unique about that remote?It is 4 HDMI ports. I dont know why you need all those HDMI ports. You might put a DVD player for me, I dont have that one DVD.Deep player to it.I dont have a VHS player. I dont play video games. I guess Ive had a camera or something.That would be you know, I want to plug in and watch. It video off my camera that might be interesting I dont know.So that TV for 2179, 75 inch has dynamic crystal color well. I dont know the difference. I cant tell the difference side.Probably wouldnt buy it dont be out.How you doing good? How are you? Maybe theyll the Seahawks pensive you dont know which one to buy?They all have different features will you look at this ones 2100 dollars?75 inch theres one on the other side.For $100 H you know its OK now this visio.

 Im in the basement of our home.
 And.
 As I stated earlier, we do run a home office out of our home business.
 And we do keep a few things Ill take you through what Im talking about.
 Ive talked about this we dont have much of a set of primitives, not a real fancy office and its in the basement basement is not not finished.
 But weve done partial finish an ad on the floor and stuff we going to like kind of industrial.
 Its pretty Big 9 inch but 1700 square feet.
 We have plenty of space.
 And we sell orthotics and prosthetics and theres just some of the.
 Samples and Imma Tori, keep on hand.
 And, of course, our dog or dogs home, but we dont use it anymore. Anyways. you asked about brochures.
 And boxes.
 So we do keep some brochures.
 Heres one of the file cabinets we have. And if I look in the bottom drawer here.
 You can see that we have
 Brochures. Heres uh the-- Heres the Brother brochure for Window printer. And heres another brochure. Here is the paperwork for the HP.
 And well we keep--
 Important--I think if its probably expensive items, not just business. But I would say expensive items. I kept the brochure on my Bose headset.
 Its in my night stand.
 And.
 But for as far as.
 Things we buy for the business, we keep the brochures for sure. They have come in handy.
 You know for these you have to go back and order toner, or you have to re-set up your network.And you write the password and serial number in there.
 In the past, weve had a problem with-- we had a hard drive go out in one of our laptops or--
 Desktop computers.
 And so for that we also--
 We had the book you know where the serial number written down. We had all the contact information, you know how long the warranty is.
 That kind of stuff is really important.
 You buy a computer and throw everything away.
 You know, you may have even forgot where you bought it from, what date you bought it, did you register it?
 So I think its important to register all that stuff, I think its important to keep the brochures. Boxes-- if theyre small enough,
 You keep em.
 We got some of the boxes we cant keep everything. But heres a couple laptop boxes that we keep--have kept.
 You know heres for a Dell we have for the business. Theres the laptop-- laptop.
 Box from my-- the laptop I currently use. Heres a laptop box for one, I use on the--
 A Dell I use on the road. And theres a Dell inside thats an old Dell inside of that.
 Box there.
 But if we do keep the boxes are small enough and they stayed like right there is where they live.
 Amongst all of our other stuff.
 Yeah, so if our like our TVs we do have funny we have the brochures for those.
 And I believe.
 Believe it or not. Im guessing he might be inside of this, this deal here. Its taking a look at just a footstool.
 Keep batteries in here of all things but cables for the TV and such and there, I know where all of our TV steps in their VCR.
 Here is for the yeah right there is a TV.
 Instruction box or instruction pamphlet brochure, so I think we do keep all that stuff.
 This whole piece here.
 Hello book, there is for?
 Are.
 Controller terrier controller for heat and cool so we do keep them.
 And Id odd place to put him in that footstool.
 But thats where they live right now.
 So I could find all the TV brochures.
 Anything thats electronic I think electronic is a hard piece of you throw the stuff away.
 You my age, you forget how to use it or what it does or when you register where you buy that.
 So were pretty good about keeping that information.
 Anyways thats my story.

Let me take a look in here in store only.Cant do that, after fries anywhere near me.So what is this one this isfrys.coms Web Price Bredbury?OK, so this is only 55 inch but Um Yeah. Thatll work at 67 days ago. I dont know if that deal still gonna be good.But Ill take a look.So thats currently 497.We go back and take a look here.44712 399 in court.I see.And check out the features first specifications and help run any facture motion every 120 and I want to have done.HD our minds, only a 60 so thats good and all tragedi, um thats good features that Ive only had this concurrency 0447. Yeah, that is right, oh, but still 447 view court.447 South fact matter is thats not bad deal, um when we go to Amazon and see.And you 6900.Nope. Sorry.And you 6900.55 inch.Alright so.End music.6901. So this one so.Even cheaper shooter.Frys it appears 4020. Thats used, Yeah, but I can look here and say its only 7 ratings.Thats fine want to go by.So, but it doesnt, it is 4 K Um. It is 120 motion rate, which is nice. I dont have that currently.It is alter HD which is nice. I dont have that currently um so I dont know that this would be.You know the way I decide on. This honestly as far as extended warranties. Um, I probably wouldnt go and extended warranty.Simply because it is a television. I dont think Ive ever bought an extended warranty on TV, but honestly thats really how.Shop Im going to look for.Im going to look for the.Best deals for my money and that might be who knows about Samsung last time I probably I sent him again.But you know, Im not gonna be stuck with a specific model as long as the TV has my features. I want I feel like Im getting a good deal on it.This Sony seems like it be a good deal. But anyway, so this is Im getting a good deal on it.You know, I will.Probably buy it.As far as the warranty goes with people still Squaretrade app.No, dont currently have squared up so if I went to the square trade website and look there.Let her buy protection for a television.And homes.Well then.That price range to your protection 5499. I just wouldnt do. It just wouldnt and it would happen that that that price.Instead of 5499 that price would have to be ridiculously. Low should have to be less than $20 and then it would just Im just do it.Just because but for 2 years now, I trusted TV the last 12 years.I mean, its not.Its not something that I carry around its not something gets broken.Anyway I hope that helps if if you need more information. If you need me to go in more detail.I can do so.You know, but thats it. Im not married to any specific brand II know I like. My current sorry about my keys. I know I currently like my Samsung TV but.You know for Sony came out that was just as good as the features that I want that wasnt credit better price.Now be my decision factor and I die checks II checked slick deals or bens bargains for most anything.Tell.I thought hope it helps.","10 - Television

 Honestly, there’s just to many unknowns to me to have a definite opinion. I would be concerned that a service plan that covered everything would either be REALLY expensive or be so restrictive in its ability to be used that it wouldn’t be worth it to the consumer. You stated a “small monthly payment” so I would assume such a service plan would include a deductible for each repair/replacement and that deductible would probably be set at a high level as to discourage overuse or abuse by the customer.
 Now, I would appreciate it if they did assist with the cancelling of existing plans and getting the difference prorated back. While I’m still not sure I would use such a service I think that’s a great selling point.
 
 To make me more at ease with buying a one-size-fits all monthly service contract I would want at least the same coverage for the items what I currently have extended warranties. That way I know I’m not losing out by jumping to a new provider. Clear-cut up front pricing and terms would also make me more likely to join.
 
 I don’t want to pay monthly for a year only to find that my iPad isn’t covered because it was a gift, or since I bought something at a store and I cannot produce a receipt I should know up-front whether or not that device would be covered. I would want to know if this plan is for repairs, replacements, or both. Is there a threshold in dollar amount? Would you attempt to repair a $50 portable speaker or would you just replace it? If it was replaced, would I be allowed to pick said replacement or would I just get whatever was sent. Is there a limit to the number of repairs per contract? What about in a certain time limit? I know companies are in business to make money but are they going to make a service request so difficult that I don’t even want to deal with the trouble?"," , I would have no problem doing so. I hope it’s alright with you but I think I’m going to upload another video to answer those questions instead of just writing them. I think I can better explain myself without having to worry about typos. 😉",,,,

But its been 10 years. But when I did work there part of the big push was extended warranty.So.Im really leery about extended warranties. I know a lot of things that we sold soon warranties on kind of worthless. However, I also know.That some of the things we sold extended warranties on were.Worth it.Things that are Garren almost guaranteed to break things are guaranteed to have a problem.So I uploaded a photo of my squaretrade page that shows what I currently or previously had extended warranties on hope that helps.But Ill try to go over that the best I can use my brain. I did write down what I currently have?Extended warranties on Dillons my sons, Nintendo switch have a warranty on it, that warranty expires February of 2021.We bought about that extended warranty in this year.Considering the fact I havent bought it doesnt work any other spurt portable devices things. Give me any of his other gaming systems.But we did buy in on that because that was just a 7 year old with a $300 portable.Gaming system that you can carry around and drop thats pretty much guarantee. Im going to be using that extended warranty.The next thing discuss this in a previous video Canon my printer the.Fifth printer that I bought in the course of 5 years or whatever. Yeah, I got extend warranty on that that warranty expires December.At the end of December of this year.Surprisingly.I have had the issue with this one that Ive had with the others, which could be due to the fact that it gets used a lot more now.With my wife being school counselors in the life of that plus my son being in school, where print a lot more. We used to so the likelihood of the print **** get clogged.Is a lot less?The third thing that I have a warranty on an I have no idea why it bothers warranty with my wife silhouette cameo.Device.Not typically something that I buy an extended warranty.Its really something that.I would expect break maybe when maybe when I got it when we got it. It was just new and.Really didnt know a lot about it, butNever do it again I probably wouldnt buy that in warranty that being said the extent where I might have been done dirt cheap.So.Things that I previously had extended warranties on besides what was on that Squaretrade page. Ive had extended warranties on my cell phone.My wife cell phone.And my Apple watch lets weve had Apple care for.All 3 of those, and I believe the Apple care on all 3 of these devices.Just ran out right now in September.I would buy Applecare again.Every if I get a new cell phone on getting Apple care again, Ive had numerous phones and.TheresYou know theres always an issue of dropping a phone and the screen cracking or it just.Not working right in the more you know, so I would do that again.So as far as Applecare. Those are all my devices that Ive purchased.Other than that before Applecare was a.What I felt like it may be as before applecare existed? I had squaretrade warranties on my phone?Purchasers Squaretrade warranties on my sons, iPad I guess with my wifes iPad at that time.Lets see what else Im not sure.But to just go back up you know.When when a device is more likely to break.Im much more likely to.Buy a warranty.Because at that point I dont feel like its.Warranty its more of an insurance policy.In the even if I didnt have to have insurance on my car. Id still have it because the likelihood of.Somebody running into me.Longer time lines long enough is almost 100% or may run into somebody else, so thats why it comes down to.I can pretty much guarantee that my kids going to drop that.Nintendo switch sadness extended warranty on it pretty much guarantee them and drop my phone, then cially well.

Im going to end up building my own but lets see what they have?Towers.So I have to have a lot of ram because I frequently have a lot of programs.Um.Graphic design programs open and they use a lot of memory.Its not unusual for me to have.10 or 15 Windows Open at a time so thats Internet windows and graphic design windows.I have the HP envy desktop.700 model modified right now, so this is.Kind of similar.This would be similar to what I have coz I have the core I 7.Only I have, I have 24 gigabytes of memory this one has.16.A terabyte of hard drive thats about what I have.This is pretty similar to what I have.Except.The processors a little better.Oh, interesting that they have 3 and a half stars for the reviews.Thats not good well there are only 8 reviews.Wow.Not much of anything else.Lets see what the other pictures are.I can see the glare from that aluminum case.If the sun hits, it wrong, I mean, as well, just lay down and wait for the migraine to pass.Not really a fan of that case.Forget that text back.OK clicked on that.Here they have a 32 gigabyte, memory option. Thats good. Thats an increase over what I have and I definitely if I was going to get a new one, I would upgrade.4 years ago, 24 gigabytes of ram was it was super was a superhighway not so much anymore.Animal at Intel octane memory is.The says Intel on it, its probably pretty darn good, though right.Seems like every time I buy a computer there, I have to.Do a bunch of research for all the new things that theyve come up with to put on the computer.To replace the things Im already familiar with.That s a good graphics card.Ive never used in looking here at this.Integrated Bluetooth Ive never used the Bluetooth on my desktop computer before I dont know why.Always use them wireless.The office software it just peeves me off.When I get a new computer and I have to um.Purchas or reload all of my computer programs have to take him off the old computer cancel the registration.Put him on the new one reactivate the registration means meme is what is set aside a whole day for installing all that stuff?I wish now the power supply. I wish you came with a backup power supply and if I build another computer.In the near future to replace this one probably try to get a backup power supply built into the computer if thats even possible.Where I live the power frequently goes out and gets super cold and things freeze and trees fall and the power goes out.I would just like to have as much back up as I can possibly get.Um.Everything on here looks good.Now the last time I got a computer the old monitor that I had I had to quickly find.An adapter for the connectors. I have since upgraded my monitor so thats not an issue anymore, OK, so heres the warranty.One year limited hardware warranty.Click on this link and I need a phone support. I do used that last time.Because after about 30 days, I had a hardware issue.And Um, I had a call and.Talk to somebody at age *** and they walked me through like in half a day to get this accomplished.They walked me through.Resetting one of the hardware devices.And it fixed the problem for about 2 weeks and then it happened again. But I had taken notes on how to fix it.So I fixed it again.And knock on wood it hasnt happened again and its been more than 3 years, so I think I did, I bought an extra years.Warranty and support for the computer after that happened.And I didnt have to use it at end it expired and then they they called me free let Leslie to get me too.Re up it and I didnt because I figured by the time. It broke again. I would be ready to upgrade so I just didnt.Software included.I hate McAfee hate it when they include I guess they have to include something when it comes to antivirus but I wish they would.Everybody would ******* the McAfee high horse and start including Norton as just a pet peeve.Also I know you want to know about extended coverage and how I feel about that on computers on.Im all for it.Because the computer when I buy a computer. Its not generally the $299 when that you can get.Off the shelf at Walmart.I dont feel like that ones going to last me as long as a computer that I can build.Pick up the specs myself and put it together, not literally but.Make sure they all go well together and are going to function for what I need and how I use it.So Ive spent a lot on the computer and I want to know that Ive got a warranty and support as well.Although I probably wont keep it for the life of the computer because Im expecting an upgrade and the same would hold true for.Cell phone iPhones you know upwards of $1000 and if Im ******* that kind of money into.Found which is in my hand Im going to say probably 8 hours a day no lie.OK, thats probably exaggerated maybe 6 hours a day.Im going to want a service contract on it or some kind of warranty or insurance. And so I think I have insurance through.Either Apple or AT&T on this particular phone my iPhone 8 plus Im running out of time.Going to stop this one and start a new one.","10: Part 1, Desktop PC",,,,,,

This is the one were going to do, we may make a phone call the tivo.Before the final decision, but of course, that s a whoever you get on the phone.

So were going to try to be as thorough as we were before.But were going to try to get her done in less than 10 minutes and get it uploaded hopefully.Maybe now lets see were going to look at a table. We have 2 tables, which I showed you before, in my little home tour.One ofem is obsolete doesnt record from an antenna which weve cut the cable.Cut the ties to cable because it got really expensive the second one that we do have does work with our antenna.But it only records.2 shows at a time so were looking for something that would have it record to it with an antenna.And would record more than 2 shows at a time. We started at Best Buy because we kind of like a store that has a brick and mortar option.Because it does have some more support and place. You can go for answers and if you have a problem.We started searching and I hate to do this to you, but we just typed in table.And the OTA means over the airwaves thats how we kind of narrowed it down. This is the only version are the only one that Best Buy had. We also wanted to the.Tivo site, we can go there and wait for them and.Look atWell, they have there, but Evil Bolt.Which is or refer started but I like to go to best buycause result is a dirty boy dealer?The same prices are the same but you can talk to somebody is a lot easier to bring things back if.In need to.Our current antenna is just a Its actually our second one weve had, and we get about 60 channels.With this antenna one of the problems is that depending on.Which season is the way it shows we sometimes have to kind of retain the things we cant get all the channels all at once.So another thing were looking at is upgrading to a better antenna.This one can read through and you know free TV is great and we get all the channels. We want but.This one is HDs got 11 terabytes of space, which is a lot of memory and this particular one has 4.Lets see for 2 years.And it or one to her, but you can record and play for shows at once, but only one intenerate, but only one antenna? Yeah.And.Which we were very recent empty nesters so our kids? Dont really have TVs or anything else in their rooms. We just have the?Basically, the one that we watch we do watch some upstairs in our bedroom 2 and we had the.Old original table there and then we could come to download programs from the line tivo to the other one, but its very slow so.I would just kind of use the other TV in bedroom for watching movies and stuff.Just as a DVD and no intent on it right now.So this one says you have 150 each. D hours dont really care bout HD original tivos.I think they think the one were currently using as a fourth one. They eventually just wear out or they become obsolete or who knows what?TVs been very, very good about giving us new ones are old ones out because weve been with them for.Forever.Probably just thought since they started.And I dont care that much about 8 dbi can, we use to put our.Recording.Thing very, very low just so we could fit Mall in this is huge so probably want to do that.Art evil or our TV is also somewhat old.And its definitely HD. But we dont really care that much, so were using an antenna so you dont always get.And sometimes we actually get pixels and I still watch the shows out want to go back to Best Buy in show how we were looking at their menus so.Because it s a tivo. It started out looking at TI vo to see whats there and whats current.And we always like to look at actual stores.Because again you can talk to somebody can ask question is easy to pick it up and is easy to return.Nothing really wrong with the boys had very good service with them. But I dont like to sit and wait for things and its just easier if theres somebody directly can talk to.Unfortunately, this one says its invaluable within 250 miles of Roseville.Nearest to have it shipped from Best Buy and then we can go to Best Buy if we have issues.Yep.***** gets all the things here, you know what this says goes through generally go through and read all the things.I always laugh at things that are frequently bought together.Sometimes on these things you see that.People by 2 different things out of the same thing or almost competitors at the same time a night.And how many people truly by that, but OK so we usually go to the reviews that s a really good indicator.Us what humans actually think.And I usually keep kind of keep in mind that.Most people are more inclined to leave. You there a negative or positive probably more negative. So when I look at something like this and see about 2/3, 3/4 of people.Are the 45 you know? I feel pretty good about it in 10% that are given to one?That means a something really, really take them off, and they just really dont like it forever reason, the Jews on the threes are probably the most honest.So I look through the pros and the cons and what people think and what people like.This guy says extremely disappointed.Namely, real detailed reason why I scan this before, and he had some real problems, he sent it back.They sent the thing to him without accord and without a remote so I couldnt use it right away.Totally understand why hes not pleased this is really not the way that.Till usually works, yeah, you know, I never really had really good luck with them and so this is something that will keep reading.And so the 2.You know premium price, but not premium features.Truth to 4 DVROTO Air OTA recording and Best Buy curing 3 of them.Tivo is the most expensive we like tivo just because what we always had.And you know, weve had pretty good luck with them for a long, long time.And they stand behind their product if we, weve had something where did it go bad or did it.

Good luck studying it up and everything went well.I also like to look at how long ago. These things were at the first one, that was upset with 2 months.Listen most 3 weeks is 5 months.Things change and then they dont always change the model or sometimes. They change the programming and um or they had the original software, they got.Updated recently or something you know, there s a lot of things. This is far months ago and He.You know, he had it pretty good experience it looks like.You know this tivo has Hulu and Netflix and.YouTube and whole bunch of other things on it is sort is my TV and sort of our Blu Ray players so.Thats not really a plus. But it is kind of handy to have that on there.You know, he really likes Romeo thinks it s a great deal.OK, were going to stop this now, and then well do a wrap up.

 One smile, we reference them for warranties.

 Once in a while we sell something on eBay and its always nice to have the book with it.
 Um.
 Mostly we just keep them out of habit and then eventually in 5 years we go through OK. Im being generous only.
 Only 5 years passed go through another way as we throw away the appliances removed on most electronic things dont seem to have a life.
 Once they die.
 But a longer Berger baskets when you have the paper that came with them as a value on say eBay.
 Things like that there are some things that have lifetime warranty is more mechanical things then.
 Electronics we have some kitchen shears that weve replaced more than once in that information is always on that.
 Insert from the package pampered chef things have a lifetime warranty and things like that.
 So its its habit we keep it for all of those things.

 In the file cabinet and this summer. We took time to file them by category good broad categories. I believe.
 House is one of them, which is appliances.
 Electronics Farage Kitchen.
 Living areas the motorcycle.
 I cant read that long A Berger that has its own category. All built into the house is one of them.
 And in the bedroom so its mostly sorted by where they are as opposed to what the thing is.
 We wait it out a lot, that we had gotten rid of overtime and not of course, gotten rid of the books so.

I feel like every time a new one like the iPhone 10 is coming out.No, its getting ready to call mail you know this one gets lower the battery doesnt last as long and so on, and so forth.And were out of memory, so I have been considering of upgrading.But essentially what I do it before I upgrade to Horizon as I always like to go to apple.com and as you can see on their homepage. In their advertising for the axe in the access.But I know that they have phones in between that new one coming outcause, sometimes home by the technology the second it comes out?I like to make sure it works out all those bugs.So to speak so sometimes I would prefer to have a newer phone than mine.And at Apple let you compare the iPhone models.So.I know how this success, not the 6 S plus.My sisters have the aid so I would look at the 8 plus.With the new.Access because if you look at the access Max. Its bigger and thats why I dont like the pluses because.See this is what I have now compared to the plus version. I have that one thats the plus version.I prefer smaller phone is easier to keep in there, so will put mind that I already have here on the left for comparison.Yeah, I filmed I will sorry about the success.And then I believe it is the 8 because I dont think I want the 8 plus because if you will get 8 plus its bigger.And then the iPhone apps.Or 10 whatever theyre going by.And I guess the new one is the access.So yes, theyre all comparable size are they all come in the color that I would want.The main difference here looking at it is the iPhone 8 still has that home screen button. Either way that that want to bother me.Ive never had anything with the face ID the surface that I currently have that youre like watching me do this on?Has arm?The pass code.The newer surface if I was upgrading that has the face ID.You know, Ive heard you see all the funny jokes about what if your face doesnt look like you.I kinda like the touch ID right now on the touch ID on my iPhone it allows me to do everything.You know save all my passwords and everything like that, so Im going to use to it, but I guess I could get used to a face ID.The bionic chips, obviously differ. However, I have no no clue as to what that is now the one thing I like about the new access on the left.This is the newest phone is the ****. It can be into meters of water for up to 30 minutes cause Im kind of clumsy.Thats why I always keep in ensuring plan on all the phones no matter what.The wireless charging on.Is one of the newer features are not quite sure of mine? Has it but we now have wireless charging stand at home coz.The I watch so that would be interesting to see and then another thing I always look at upgrading but Im pretty sure that all.Of the above devices coming here so now Im sorry.Thats lined up so the new one is called the 512 gigabytes.On.You know thats pretty important because.Your phone gets slower as you get messages and I dont like to delete emails and Id only to delete message threads.So we something or can do because that you can buy it in.A gigabyte that Ive never seen before.I believe currently actually have the 64 gigabyte. So I would definitely be looking to upgrade to one of these in the middle of the 256.But its interesting to see that they even have the access in the 512.And then this will tell you about all the display settings on.So.I mean?No.Nothing really here stands out to me.Because I like to.I mean?Im not really tech savvy with those numbers so they dont really mean much to me the size and the weight as I said, Before, I mean, weights on an issue.The size they are all about the same 5.655, .45, the width. I would like to keep it. Thats why I keep it like that as opposed to.If we put the wants a plus in there.And it goes to 6.24 inches. I dont like that.And then splash of water resistance.So the way this reads to me, oh waitcause. We have the 60 player I would be looking to buy the 8.So.What I have now?Disco I wish I would show force. I could see what I have now but I have now is technically not splash water and dust resistant.Although I mean, I definitely splash water on it, and its been fine but.It would be nice to have this with the you know the one meter over here in the 2 meters over here.Whatever assistance.Like I said the chip really doesnt mean much to me.Now the camera. I do like the newer cameras, they do like.Taking pictures and everything like this and actually Im doing this is a video because I know that the new iPhone.Has the screen recording all?I think that would be updates mind canal do the screen recording like via the phone. But it was easier for me to do a video and go on here.But if you look at the 8 versus the new the accent, the access. Its all they now have the portrait mode.Which, when I was in Nashville? My friends brother had that and it was pretty nice for pictures um?You also have portrait lighting effects, which kind of change the background photo so thats something I would look into.That s a reason I would take the axe over the 8.On the access would still be in the running, though, because of the fact that its even more water resistant.Video recording of.I know.No no thats interesting Id have to research out some more about stereo recordingcause other than that. They all the same to me nothing really.Sticks out.Front camera this just means for selfie.Same concept its me know this one has the portrait lighting and everything like that.Filter your phone right there.Carriers I Verizon.Cellular wireless data secure offering station.The face that arch of them have Apple, which I do have now my phone.Face time audio playback video playback, Siri power battery to power battery.Is important to me?Put the 8 last as long as the 7.Well see what it says about what I have now the sick.OK, well doesnt say anything will see what it said about the 7.The 7 lasted 2 hours longer than the 6 S, which is I have.And I wanna Welcome to upgrade to last about the same here figured 2 hours more which is good because you know from my previous post.How is give the battery charger now this?X is 2 hours longer than this, which means 4 hours longer than my phone now and that is 30 minutes more sets of 4 and a half hours more.Oh.Lets say itll tell you.The Internet uses the same for all.Which is really what I use it for so let me see?So I would go and I would see the 6 ***.And then I would really compare because the up to 10 hours and then 12 hours in the video playback is also.An audio playback, so those are the 3 things like Ill talk on the phone. Once you those are the 3 things I would look for and thats an upgrade from this phone to.Up to 53% charge in 30 minutes thats good.Mine doesnt even say what it would be.Looks like theyre all to 50% charged the difference is, though, that these 2 have a longer lasting charge.Included headphones ear pods with the lighting Kentucky connectorcause they have that new.Adapter at the bottom where you can t I guess charge.At the same time.Sensors.Not really doesnt mean much to me.And let you do the text backs.",Then after the research at Apple.com I would go to the Verizon store to price out what an upgrade would cost especially since the features between the 3 are so similar.," Omg that would be a great service! So yes I think that we would definitely be interested in something like that. My only concerns would be 1) any fees such as deductibles as there seem to be with Asurion, 2) would this service cover accidental damage and lost/stolen products, 3) what would the turn around time on service be, 4) would service happen in home or would you have to bring the device to the location?",,,,,

 50 Bucks maybe? Im not sure. But it seemed like it was worth it. You know. Cause the TV I did get a really good deal on, but I thought. Hey, if Im going to get this sort of cheaper brand TV.

My initial impression when I read it was that it sounds too good to be true. My second thought is having enough trust in the company that I would want all of my devices managed by one company. Seems less risky to manage individual items myself on a case by case basis. But then again, I don’t have a lot of high dollar equipment I need help with. The small monthly fee is appealing. I tend to purchase extended warranties when money is rebated back to me for not using it. So I have the best of both worlds...coverage if needed, but some refund if I didn’t need it. I’m also leery of warranties where there is a flat fee and a deductible applied per item.

 Inherently, pretty disposable. I do, do a few things that may be helpful for you in your research. So for big ticket items like my appliances and stuff
 I typically do some sort of extended warranty and I normally buy my electronics through Costco or I do a lot of them through Costco because they offer an extended warranty past.the original manufacturers date. And Costco allows me to keep everything handy based on my membership receipt. My appliances and things that I do.Like my washing machine and my refrigerator and things like that. I do with my Lowes card because that is all tracked on that purchase.
 For electronics I am really, really good about registering each product. I buy part of it is kind of mygeeky research nature and kind of a love for consumer feedback and so I always fill out the kind of warranty andcustomer service reply cards and things like that that are given to me, but I typically put all of the.
 I try to use the same username and the same password for all of these individual product registrations because that makes iteasy when Im trying to figure out when something has died. If a it is still under warranty or can be fixed.
 I recently had a product well my Fitbit kind of quit charging and I chatted online and found out thatit was a defect in they sent me a new one. So I kind of try to do that as much as possible, and be as savvy as I can.
 Uh since, you know things are expensive.
 I dont traditionally keep warranty information in a specific place. I like to keep the booklets and stuff like I showed in previous videos.
 I feel like its really wrong to throw away product manuals and especially again for like appliances and big ticket items. I keep all of those in case I sell my house or need to sell it.
 I have bought things like Apple care. Ive extended that on my phone, so that I have screen replacement.
 And some of those things taken care of. But in general, depending on the cost of the item. I dont typicallypurchase extra warranties and I definitely dont from like geek squad or Best Buy or any of those types ofplaces.

I would never buy it on line, though something like this actually.Originally thought I wanted in OLED because its the breast the best price to performance.So Im going to Google that.He.Wow.Too much too expensive.

I want to Smart TV want it to be power efficient. I know the newest isnt.Edge LAD, but I think that thats price prohibitive so Im not going to probably even search for that.Plasma is out here they dont have the best picture, in less its 42 inches plus and I dont even.Havent seen any plasma.Lately.Im not gonna help Best Buy with feedback OK here is kind of what I want I do not know.Brands are all made in Korea.Pretty much anyway, try to compare apples to apples here, I dont know what U HDTV with HDR is.So I dont know if I need it or want it.Uh want to Smart TV HD TV.So.I dont know what Roku is I want to Smart TV.So maybe Im looking at.You know, Im either looking at.The Samsung, the Visio.You know the Smart TV, Ill have to research and see if I want.U HDTV with HDR not let me click on this and see what this says.See if I understand it.Well, it certainly doesnt give an explanation.Come on.I dont even know what it is.OK, now its the warranties because you want to know about that? Whats important to me.They obviously want to sell the geek squad warranty 2 years for 55 years for 80 on a $400 purchase. I probably wouldnt spend either of those is soo, however, percentage.I know manufacture warranties dont cover much.Gramma little bit more of a risk taker.OK lets look at the plan here.The only warranty that I would want is if it was a smaller percentage of the purchase price if it.If it covered for parts and labor as well as in home and you know, I dont want to spend anymore out of my pocket.I have to commit to a certain.Time period and then have it.Be up.Im not the person that buys warranties manufacture warranty women facture warranties. They only cover you for salon. Yes, thats true.Um geek squad enhance your coverage for up to 5 years.Everything has a price.In home normal wear and tear or pixel.Insulation in calibration.Power surge.For parts and labor 1% of parts and labor are covered so mean that looks like a pretty good deal. But.Again, I probably would not spend.Um, I probably wouldnt do anything for 2 years cause chances are was going to fail. Its going to be after that.I wouldnt spend $80 again a fifth of the purchase price for the warranty I just.He.I just wouldnt.Can we go back and would I would look for since its not explaining to me the difference between the in the U HDTV and.The non U HDTV.And there is a price difference.Looks like most of them are U HDTV so I probably investigate that.So that would require me to get out of this.Enough of this website.In Google, it, which Im not going to do because.You want me to stay here.I dont know what Roku is again like, I said Ben anyway. There s a price differential love.Between 102 $100 for the.Just a smart HDTV versus the.U HDTV with HDR so I mean, if it was. I dont know it was something I need again. I would have to Google, it and see and then I would.Make that decision I would also then I would take maybe the 4 top brands, you know probably which are Samsung.LG.Maybe sharp.Visio.I dont know if thats good or not.Again, there pretty much all men, Korea and then I would check the consumer.Um.Ratings and I might check consumer report as well.I found before in my previous 2 attempts, I found.Consumer ratings.Availability doesnt matter to me because I wouldnt order online anyway would actually go in. I would look at the TV I would see how.How the picture was a clear was the definition around the edges the curves?Um.See how sharp and clear it is.How it looked in in terms of motion? I dont watch a lot of sports on TV so thats not.A big consideration of mine.And thats how I would probably end up choosing you know apples to apples in terms of brand as long as they were within like $50.Of one another.Try to figure out here where the red found the.Consumer ratings.Im trying to hurry here because I only have a minute and 20 seconds more. Im just not going to do this again here we go.Ratings and reviews blah blah blah, I would look at this for all of them.Um come on.Come on.This one has none here we go 91%. I know in a couple of the others. I Celica 97 and 95%.So unless this work quite a bit cheaper, probably wouldnt consider this although thats not a very big.Difference between 96 and 91%.Let me look so I am going to go ahead and what I would do is I would look at all of the consumer ratings.For these and then you know, probably make my list of the 4 top.Apples to apples comparison for top brands.And then go in and try and pick those out.In the store, maybe talked or rap.And see what the best picture was and also investigate what U HDTV is to see if I really need it.They probably would because it looks like its between 102 100 more.And that would definitely be an upgrade from my Current TV.",Upgrade,Thank you,,,,,

 Its late I just got home from working out, but anyway, so I can about warranties. I never buy an extended warranty.
 I usually
 Get around to registering them if they have a warranty, but I dont buy an extended warranty.
 And because I guess Im more of a risk taker than risk averse and I kind of calculate with the odds are.
 Um.
 With regard to something happening or my getting a lemon I guess.
 In another important factor is that normally with warranties.
 You know you will cover labor or theyll cover parts in, not labor or vice a Versa and they never seem to cover everything.
 In so you know given the low inherent risk.
 In the cost of the warranty.
 And the fact that a lot of basically electronics are.
 You know have built in obsolescence, anyway and.
 Technology.
 Is changing so quickly?
 Really dont want to invest anymore than I have 2 in anyone particular.
 Um apparatus.
 But I just dont think that extended warrantys are worth it because they dont cover everything and their costly.
 Um.
 With regard to
 The risk I dont think there s a lot of inherent risk.
 What would make me purchase an extended warranty?
 One.
 It would have to be a higher capital item.
 Um something.
 That Ive seen other people have trouble with maybe.
 That tends to have more problems than.
 Other apparatus.
 It would have to cover.
 Both.
 Labor and
 Parts.
 And it would have to last more than like 6 months or a year depending on what I thought the life of the product was but.
 Definitely longer term.
 Um.
 You know, I think theres always a reason is kind of like insurance. There s a reason that they offer that.
 In it s a money maker for them.
 So if you look at you know that the actuarial tables with probability it cetera. There is a reason that they offer them and theyre making money on them because.
 The risk is.
 Is lower end?
 And they put that money in their pocket.
 So.
 Thats my feeling about extended warranties and I honestly.
 Dont have one.",11,,"I have never purchased an extended warranty. I have heard tales of people who have had warranties which were pretty worthless because either the labor or parts werent covered, which requires deres them essentially useless and they ended up being a money-loser. Ive also read lots of warranty coverage, which usually serve to reinforce my decision not to purchase...statistics, people, statistics. Not cost-effective.",,Where is the screen recording I just did?????????????????????,I completed my last task.

 Is going to be a TV will look into replace the TV and power?
 Living room with a bigger one and then move that TV up into our bedroom and then.
 Im able to know what were gonna do it tomorrow. Maybe well give it to one of the kids but?
 That would be the plan.
 And Im definitely not going to go to the store to do this because then I might be tempted.
 End up buying something sooner than we really are planning to for budgeting reasons, so but I would usually always.
 Kind of start by going to Best Buy for something like a TV so first kind of go and just see on the front page of Best Buy?
 Um if they have anything that might apply to a TV like I say here its.
 Whoops well it, Im Im OK with like an open box, but I dont know if they do that for TV so lets see.
 Have like an open box deal.
 Again, obviously if in this case, wed be.
 Looking at.
 Getting it pretty much right away because if its open box. That means its going to go fast.
 Come on C.
 The other good thing about going to Best Buy.
 For anything like a TV or appliances is that they will price match. If you go and find it somewhere cheaper but.
 Um, I have found that most cases like only bought like a refrigerator or stove or anything else might have bought from their quitting think we bought at least one or 2 TVs in there previously.
 Usually end up finding one of those things on a great sale. Dylan so youre not generally going to find the exact same.
 Item somewhere else for less in their Best Buy only price match is coming on for.
 Um regular price items. I believe I dont think they price match off sales.
 Come on.
 Well.
 Not gonna let me go.
 That would take me to the open boxes.
 Shuffle mother ago.
 Last chance to save featured out with details and keep putting tablets and accessories suitors headphones.
 Apple products and major appliances, I dont see.
 TVs, so it doesnt look like they do TVs unless it happens. I dont think it would be.
 I dont think its going to be under open box.
 Computers but lets just look in box.
 Also, that much offer some of these items, considering their open box deals.
 I dont think I would buy an open box is for the sake of saving $10 or so I mean thing.
 Something like that, for couple 100, Yeah, but can I know were not looking at?
 Computers were looking at.
 Dying.
 ATV so me while ago.
 Come on lets go.
 Television there.
 TVs soon so I think our TV downstairs right now is like a 27 inch.
 29 in somewhere there, so I think we upgrade the TV will probably going to looking in the 50 inch range.
 And I really.
 Dont see spending like 1000 dollars on a TV my probably our maximum budget for a TV is somewhere in the $500 range.And TVs have actually come down quite a bit over the last couple years from what they used to cost so.
 I do is I would look for something in the 50 inch range and I actually like Samsung, the car think at least.
 One of our TVs might be a Samsung and weve been happy with it fact. Im just going to, I would look.
 Alexa lets make the one down up in my room. I think the one downstairs a Samsung this is.
 A dynex upstairs, which I think is Best Buy brand actually but so lets see here is a Samsung 50 inch.
 Markdown.
 50 Bucks and um.
 No, it does show open box from 37599, but 8595 you like a $20 savings.
 So again Im not sure if its $20 savings for something thats
 Likely been returned. Otherwise, it wouldnt be open box would be worth it. But I would go in and kind of check out the reviews.
 I see that in the front screen. Its got 4 and a half stars.
 Blessings had quite a few so if you want to see if it was easy to hook up.
 And like how the
 The picture and like sound and stuff.
 Are so?
 Upgraded model thats about all right special offer say $50 on DTV connect and set up.
 Get Im looking for something to be easy to setup setup to pay for someone to come set it up.
 I just dont see were getting a TV something you should have to picks up on this year. I mean, less you doing, like on those.
 You know if I was actually putting out over a gram for some really large TV and likes around some.
 Maybe I could see looking for a good deal with code like having someone come out and set it up or I wanted like wall mounted or something.
 But we would be looking for something that would just basically sit on the stand that we have downstairs we just.
 Recently bought a new.
 Stand kind of replaced our entertainment center with something not quite so bulky and it actually will fit a bigger TV than what the old one would have.
 So.
 Um.
 See there. Weve actually been thinking about getting a sound bar. And we probably will breakdown and get one of those if we
 Replace the TV. So um features ""enjoy millions of shades of color.""""TV youll love for less for less."" Central contrast is certainly flight details and the brightest and dimmest scenes.
 Game mode, so the kids we could hook up the.
 Sony I think, to that.

 No, thats 4 K picture quality so thats kind of like the more new age thing would be kind of cool to have at a good price.

 Stainless steel bands.
 PVD color process gold or space, gray finishes wireless charging advanced face ID security is simple when you face.
 Is a password you can unlock your iPhone log into apps or pay for things with a glance let interesting?
 So I guess then you would have to have to type in.

 And then silver space greater goal doesnt really matter to me also use over.
 The goes up to 512 gigabytes now wow.
 So that would probably be wow, 1500 dollar 1500 dollars.
 Previous one is 1240 ninth probably go with the 256 and then.
 Verizon device payment program as well that I use and I would just add that on my bill at Apple care.
 Because I Devil do that and then get a refund of up to $525 when you straighten eligible smart phones are probably looking at that too.
 So I would go through that process, there and then I would click on continue.
 And then you know go pick it up at Verizon or forgot what I need to do from there.
 So that is the extent of how I would shop for an an upgraded iPhone that Im looking at so thank you very much for your time I appreciate it.",This is my video for 10. I looked at the new iPhone to see the differences between mine and the new iPhone. I looked at Apple.com and just walked through what I would be looking at on the site.,,"I have never used Apple care. I guess when it comes to Apple phones I have lucked out. Usually I decide on what the item is, where I bought it and how much I paid for it when I am trying to decide if I get the protection plan. If I am putting it on a credit card, it seems like I tend to buy it more because the total of the protection plan is a small amount on the monthly payment.",To me it just seems to vary. Sometimes I think that the protection plans such as Apple care are very much worth it. Other times I do not. The day I wrote this and did the video was the morning after my wife dropped her phone and broke her screen protector. Sometimes I think maybe I should get it Incase ... but then I wonder if Incase will ever happen.,,,

 this moment is 2 fold. The laptop that I have is not the best. It is very slow. It is also slow because of windows 10. I do not see why they call this an upgrade. I have not had any windows programs go this slow in a long time. It seems that windows 10 is too complex and bulky. They made it to be more simplified but it seems like the opposite happens. The program loads up slow. It literally takes so much longer than the previous versions I have used. I feel Microsoft did not use their best judgment on this program.",,,,,,

And so I dont know that its something I would need bloods nice to not exists.One time replacement bulb pull parts and labor and in the one you give the product 2, will be able to obtain it so thats even super nice.Um.But again, I think it comes down to cost and so when I go back and I look at cost. There s a couple things I want to be mindful love with that.The protection plan is the whole looks to be fairly comprehensive the challenge of it is again. I think were looking at a 12.5 percent.Cost in relationship to the overall warranty compared to the cost of the product and then the 5 year is closer to.Almost 25% am so.On one hand that super nice and if.I knew they were going to be events in the next 510 years, it would keep me from buying a television or upgrading again.This is probably what I would want to do at the same time, the cost.Is a high enough percentage that Im a little bit late?Wary of it and at the same time, I recognize that technology is changing and where this, TV is great today.Where it is in relationship to other TVs 3 years for years 5 years from now is pretty unknown.And so.For where I am in life, recognizing that I think being able to upgrade again in the next 34 years is probably.What I would likely do I would probably go with a 2 year its nicer person edge 12.5 percent.Um and 5 years seems like a really long time that I dont know that I fully need, and even if I did use it.I dont know that Im going to be necessarily happy with where the TV is, at that point in time and so.Are likely go through 2 year? I think weve talked about the reasons are ready for why this 60 inch in this case is ideal.Recognizable brand faster motion technology.Rate so low refresh rate. If there had been a TV on one of these sites that weve looked error on a Best Buy site that we looked at today?That was set for 120 or 2:40 AM.Refresh rate that wouldve been a factor that I would have probably considered a greater level of priority than what?I can send some of these other factors because again I want sports, then that refresh rate. Then begins to play pretty important role.So overall Id go the Sony Id go the 2 year warranty and things of that would be the best.",,,,,,,
550,David,10,a,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AtsQqYBWNqB3HrXDzpKvTedHWgVlkOsK&authuser=nick@gauge.io,video,"Hi suffer this part of the assignment. I have gone to bestbuy.com and Im using Best Buy.Primarily because its hard to be able to get a sense for TVs off of sites like Amazon.Theres so many different options and they tend to be brand. Names are sometimes lesser known and I dont always know what to do with those.Im also in this case, avoiding Walmart website where Walmart might be a place that I would go in person.Im online It can be a little bit confusing at points to really know what it is Im looking at and.From what Ive heard at the same time, I think that with TVs, and other things, even if theyre the same model.One of the ways that they are able to offer the price cheaper is that the materials inside of the TV.Or laptop are other things may be cheaper than what they are for the same model if you buy it somewhere else.And so.As a result, theyre able to offer at a cheaper price because theres cheaper materials inside of it. And so in this case. Ive utilized Best Buy as a starting point for this.In this case, Im going to look at TV, Faygo products. I look down. I go TV and home theater, which looks great.Well lets buy TVs by size in this case. My house, usually has around a 55 to 60 inch will look at a 60 inch TVs and.Upgrade in this case will click there a man that were looking at 60 inch TVs will notice that there are a lot of different options here.Ranging from 5 year 4 K TVs down to other TVs as well, but theres really only.3 or 4 items here again we can find they $427, here or 428.These items are listed clearance. You have to click to see the price and that s a little bit frustrating. I think early on him so.Just looking at prices at Frys was only thing they consider that for 28 is probably quite a bit cheaper.And we might want to explore why that would be.And so I dont know whole lot about high sense TVs, but well look here to kind of see it, we can explore.When I begin to do that. I find it was 449 not have giant price difference from what it is now.Save $22 its nice but its not ground breaking and.And then let that I find that if I went up. Pricing method, it would be $35.67 a month, which is really nice to know I did.I dont know that I knew that Best Buy had a financing option and so thats helpful if thats something that I was looking at.After this, I can begin to find that there are quite a few different series.Meaning of a part of the group of the same product from similar features so Im a little bit curious about what that actually looks like and what that really means.But as I begin to search in some of the things I want to keep in mind are down here. I think in some of the specifications hopefully.So I see it s a 59.5 cent 55.9 and 59 and a half inch television.I like in the specifications here because this is important to me and I notice as 3 HD MI inputs, which is OK.Its not a huge amount by the time you have a firestick, maybe every DVD player in your game system.Thats 3 automatically if I ever want to hug someone else up to it. Its not a lot. It is a 4 K TV.The motion rate is 120, which is nice to see one of the things that I might ask with it, though and so a motion rate again.Defined as the hurt is a picture error factor in motion clarity and so.And as we look at them at the refresh rate. This is a number of frames per second. The device can produce.So where this, heart rate is really nice for motion enhancement. The refreshment rate is only 60 and generally. I will at least try to get a 120 at the very lowest rate.Maybe even 240 for the refresh rate. Because so much of what I do is watching sports and so with sports its important.That there s a television thats able to really a company so many of those different kinds of elements that there s a way to have the larger.Span of space and so it s a nice thing. But its not completely necessary. I am curious if we move up and we go.Here, with like the Smart HDR plus what that looks like.Unfortunately, that doesnt appear to want to click, possibly because it just doesnt come within the.Within that size options thats unfortunate, but lets see what else we can do with this to get an idea.Pierce I might have prospect, too many times now, so this is the more expensive TV. I am curious what?LG would do ILGs in my mind is slightly more recognizable name. Ive had an LG TV it was fine.And then as I begin to look down this again. I want to go down to specifications cause thats and thats important to me and again, I find.A similar refresh rate, which is a little bit frustrating at this point. The forecast fantastic, but if the refresh rate is lower.Theres still things I missing even though what I do say may be a higher quality until it s a little bit disappointing to me.It is nice and again, it s a smart platform.Again, for K, which I really look forward to a quad core processor, which is nice and long for it to process a little bit better.Goes with the stand in this case, its not there. I want to look at this other one real fast just to kind of get an idea of what it looks like it went options are maybe.And as I do that. We think back one more time there, we go. Well see what this Sony looks like say like Sonys.When I look down at the Sony on these options again hang on the specifications. It s a similar refresh rate.But the motion enhancement technology is much higher. Its at 2:40 as opposed to the 120 that the other sad.So for me thats an immediate thing that I like much better. Its also got 3 HDMI cable inputs.So not quite as much as what I might like but knowing that has the 240 instead. I think is.Really, pretty good if a look at some of these different options again. You cant really click those but I cant see, there s a 70 inch.Available adds $999 as opposed to.759. Thats not a huge difference given the price of a given the size difference and so.If I was looking at 70 inch. I assume the specifications are the same but I am curious.Yes, so 60 Hertz 240 for the motion enhancement technology really a decent deal as a whole.4167 a month as opposed to.At $63.34 a month and so one of the differences. We see with that is.That little price difference, even though its not not even though its not a lot really has some difference in terms of how things are looking for.That monthly rate and thats helpful to know and so theres some different products here, the geek squad will protect.I try to look at the percentage of how much this is going to cost so in $800 TV.$100 warranty for 2 years 12 and a half percent not great, but not horrible 10% could be worth it. $100 seems like a lot potentially free TV.Particularly when a Walmart other site. I feel like I could probably get TV for 400 or so in this would be.Quarter of that cost.But when we look at that.You can learn about their standard protection plans.Um.20% off Im geek squad protection just helpful trying to look at what they cover in home service, which is nice.Does a 42 inch or higher meaning they understand Hey? Sometimes TVs are hard to get home and thats helpful for me.Weve got a few seconds left someone switch over to another video of this will.",,"I think I would be reluctant to try an all in one technology insurance plan. While the simplicity may appear to be there, I would have concerns about whether the program could really fit the wide array of products and brands that an insurance plan would need to be able to cover. It also seems that it could be difficult to know what was covered for specific products. This sounds simple but I tend to trust warranties that are specific to a product type. An insurance plan might be feasible but it would have to be able to cover the same amount of items with extremely clear terms and conditions that covered more than each warranty. I would also be curious about the process that is required to enter an item to be covered by the insurance. This process would need to be as easy as uploading a picture to an app. The idea of assistance getting out of warranties sounds nice but also requires a lot of work in the beginning, including being able to find those warranties, which I wouldn’t have to do all at once otherwise. I wish there was a warranty finder app included in the process.
 
 Finally, I would also wonder about cost and whether that’s something that would be covered. In a year, I normally have a small amount of money that goes towards warranty purchases. I would want to be sure that this price was not greater than what I would already pay on average per month. I also would want to be sure that the amount I paid was reflective of the cost of devices so that I’m not paying for someone who has more devices.",,,,,

 And then the thing is that I buy on Amazon, such as Amazon Echo Dot. Smart plugs those types of things.
 I will generally buy through Amazon and then its trackable by Amazon. Um and so where I can find when those warranty.
 When that warranty information is. For Amazon products its admittedly quite a struggle. I assume I would need to probably actually go through their customer.
 Service center and ask for that specific information, I could go back on track when the item was bought and when the.
 Service warranty was there, but I dont know that theres another way to do that. If there is it be really helpful to know.
 Its not really a question Ive thought about even though I bought the protection plan.
 I think one of the factors that influences whether I buy the protection plan for me is generally whether its over.
 50-100 dollars. And it will depend.
 Things I currently have a warranty plan on I have a warranty plan on the 2 large TVs that I have.
 I think all 3 Amazon Echo dots have.
 A warranty plan on em.
 Our couch, I dont know if that counts as a piece of Technology, but it plugs in to the wall and has some outlets built into it.
 And so that of course, has a warranty.
 Im trying to think everything is that we may have I dont know that there are a lot of other things that we have warranties on I think our instant pot probably has a warranty on it, but thats something I would have to check.
 But I would guess we probably bought a
 Protection plan on it. Again I think the challenge is if its usable the registration process takes some time.
 You may or may not actually register even after you bought it whether you have to sometimes I think is kind of a mystery.
 And so I dont know that I have an easy way to track when that would be. I know there are protection plans on a lot of these when they expire when they run out a lot of those questions are unknown to me and really only come up for me for the most part
 When Im really trying to find the answer in the time that something doesnt work are something fails, and falls apart.
 Um.
 Yeah.",,"I’ve been extremely fortunate that very few items have broken. The only time that I have really had to use a warranty was when our couch had some difficulty but that probably doesn’t fit into the electronics category. We were able to get the couch picked up and delivered within a few days. Through that, we had a great experience in terms of time that it took to get the repair.

 Um.
 Ive never bought an extended warranty for anything mainly because I try to shop for products that may already come with some type of warranty built into the plan whether it s a car or?
 Computer something else or something thats high quality or I dont need it. I find that the warranties are a waste of money.
 Mainly because for some warranties you could almost buy a new piece of equipment for the price that you pay for the extended warranty.
 Also I find them useless my model on it is if you cant guarantee that the device or product to build is going to last longer than.
 A few years, then you should be buying if you promote youre saying our our devices a piece of ****.
 So why dont you come and buy the extended warranty coz we know its going to breakdown or something I understand that there are warranties to.
 Cover extended services with practice, I never buy it.",Extended warranties are a waste of money and a scam.,I still wouldn’t be interested unless it was dirt cheap and had no exceptions.

Its also more efficient.Because 8 infusion chip uses I thats way above my pay grade but anyway, um see what they have.2:30 or 2374 month.Well still $600 for this.BC I have insurance on my phone, which I think would carry through.For any phone that I have is the old school insurance, which is much better than the new school insurance.There are different colors.Which really doesnt make a difference because I would probably put a case on it anyway?I see.Special offers K the special offer up here by one iPhone say the 150 an iPad.Look at that is just a way to get more money.Say Never by blah every bit as powerful.About the terminology, they use to make you buy a new phone, the iPhone 7 plus.Comes in 32 gig, which is which is good.No 28 gig the only thing I ever run out of his memory from my pictures and I use have to pay 299.To Verizon or Apple I should say a month in order to have more storage.I had read that once beforecause it wouldnt take anymore. Pictures I didnt want to delete anyway elements.Missy.So as far as the warranty goes. I think it would be the same warranty that I have as far as replacement.Its $50 to replace it is for their insurance after youve already paid insurance every month, which I think is a robot.Um.Does resistant tested under controlled laboratory conditions rating of IP 67 or IE C standard whatever that means splash water and dust resistance are not.Permanent conditions in resistance might.Decrease the result of Hey, anyway, so we see what they say as far as insurance or warranties.T.Brands.Cesar ES would you try to check the reviews to as usual, its new phone or anything new people are just working out the bugs.I dont want to be with one is people that workout bugs.I love the new iPhone out bunch of stars looks like its getting good reviews.Thats always good.Missy.Specs really dont matter to me unless that is where the insurance would be, but it doesnt look like it.Just trying to sell you more gizmos to go with it.IPhone support.Help you better understand your Verizon mobile device at Verizon Services.Apple iPhone 7 plus support so.Thinking of heading questions about it thats where I would go.Um.Special remember seeing anything about.The warranty or anything, um, I guess I could always go to the help.Of the help here right click on that, like to chat with somebody but.I dont think I want to get into all that goes up probably pressure me to buy a new phone.But but I think the warranty would be the same as I have. I just from any phone that Ive ever switch to before?I just pay pay for the insurance and switch it over. I think usually its like I have a year warranty unless you get up wet.But in this case with this one. I dont know since its water resistant or whatnot if if it gets water damage that they would cover that are not so.Thats something else, I would want to check out but I dont see.On here where I would check it out, so I guess I would just have to contact their customer service.If its not listed in the fact sheet here.Is there some between iPhone 7 sevens?My Apple iPhone is receiving or sending calls. Yes, just troubleshooting. It looks like. So, yeah, I probably have to call Verizon Directlycause. Im not seeing much.Much help on here other than support overview, which really doesnt give you a whole lot.Support overview billing and payments.Troubleshooting services in abject doesnt even list.What kind of warranty anything it has so Im probably just call Verizon I think thats all I got for now.Thanks.",I hope this is what you wanted.

I want to check Sams club as well. But.Lets take a look Apple shopping event. Lets see how about the access. Max iPhone XSOK shot now lets see.Remember before was 1249 dollars for the phone that I was looking at lets just take a look here, so the excess Max.3667 for 30 months, but its probably the base phone very little memory does take a look.And then that depends public carriers well so my carrier is Sprint so now were at 4584.But if you noticed there was a $275 Best Buy gift cards see that.Will be offered at Apple so lets take a look?So one time payment of $1099, however, I havent selected some of the good.Options that are going to boost that price. So I want space, Gray and remember 256 gig.Now I going to see the price increase.Alright so now.See its the same price because what Apple does is they dont allow retailers sell their phones any cheaper.But with the retailer will do is to offer maybe a gift card are something, so that $275 gift card. I mean, youre talking about.20% almost 20% that youre getting back in a gift card, which is an extremely good deal.So I really have to consider that the other thing. However, if I want to buy it. This is only by thought about doing that.So I could finance that coz I have a Best Buy Card 12 months free financing so now were talking about 12005 dollars.Finance over 12 months, which is basically $100 a month.Right and I couldnt $275 gift card. Now the one thing that I dont see it here and then I would one of courses.Apple care.So lets see.What Apple care costs here?Apple care for iPod.IPhone OK.So lets see how much its going to cost as well as you can see if you can use someone elses money.Thats just smart for 12 months why not? It makes it a pretty affordable deal.So lets take a look at the excess Max.Select again.OK.Sis is the other way of going and so I kind of went in from the back way didnt include Applecare and now Im going to select the same options again, however, Apple care is now added so.My carrier Sprint.I want space, Gray and I want 256 Skaggs.Right.So youll notice which interesting here, every now and then they will offer a free Apple care and Im really wondering.If thats whats going on here because I dont see an additional price.Santa car just to see what happens there now are nearly. I would log in my for security reasons. Im not. I do have a Best Buy account.And if I were really in the market right now, I would seriously consider that actually Id probably jump at it because.Im essentially using someone elses money for 12 months, so its $100 and I own that phone.As opposed to leasing it for 30 months and then I would pay somewhere in the neighborhood of about.$50 a month.So you kind of look at that so thats 1500 dollars versus if I paid it up front.12005 dollars. Im only paying $100 using someone elses money and I get it paid off in one year.And I still get the $275 gift card, so either way. Im going to get the $275 gift card.But Ill tell ya. This makes it really attractive and I would probably probably.I would jump at the zero interest financing for year.So thatBased upon what Im saying.I could get Applecare I get the phone of my dreams right now, a larger phone plenty of features.Higher resolution.And.Most importantly, Im getting it at the expense of someone else, Im using bass by or in this case.I think so. I cant remember their credit card front and singer but I am using their money for one year.So essentially end if I dont want to pay $100 a month. I dont have to, if I want to save it.In a interest bearing account, I can do that, so this is a really good deal. And I think I would do it.I would definitely upgrade my phone. I would get the Apple care theft in laws warranty and definitely.I would take advantage of it, so the X iPhone XS. Max that would be my upgrade I get everything that I want I get the creative financing.It s a good deal matter fact. Im really possible going to think about that. My phone is only about 6 months. But there is a clause in there that I could upgrade but I think about itcause. This is a really good deal. And then phone is awesome, X 6.5 ounces 3.05 inches in with thats pretty good thanks.",Upgrade cont’d,"How much is the monthly payment? Will it decrease based upon the remaining value of the device?

Will they offer a loaner device while the item is in for repair?","In general, it sounds like a pretty inviting concept.

Im really curious.About the new features and everything else, so the first thing I did was I went to theapple.com site.I miss can start looking around and look at the features see how it differs from my current iPhone Acts.And just really kind of look around and see if its kind of entice me to actually want to buy it so.Lets take a look so heres the iPhone XS.So lets learn more Im really curious OK so.What are the features whats different so?Im just gonna kinda.Look atSo whats different Super Red Moon 2 sizes, including the largest this flight ever on an iPhone wow, OK, so that means it s a little bit larger than my Apple.IPhone X.Which was actually about the same size or slightly smaller than my iPhone 7 that I really liked and I was kind of.Little bit disappointed with the access into smaller so we got so wonderful display.OK, what else what else.Spanger deeper custom oil Edie displays interesting the graphics of really good on iPhone.Alright So what about this play holy cow. Theres an access and access. Max its 6.5 inches that is huge.Now this is a true phablet, so it s a phone tablet right so when I sweat.Screen makes a difference what else exceptional materials. Most durable bless every new smartphone. So does that mean I dont need a?Tempered glass protector anymore.Take him some nice colors what else surgical grade stainless steel.PPD color process Golden Space Gray wireless charging well. My current iPhone. X doesnt 2 for advanced face ID yet. I have that with my iPhone.Thanks.What else?Nice features.I really like the way they like this out, too.Intelligent a 12 bionic.No.So the processor.The most the smartest and most powerful chip in a smartphone OK well thats interesting.What else whats kind of wildly here when we got 3 D maybe?It will bionic so this is the chipset.50% faster 15% faster performance.Lower power usage thats always important for cell phone.Holy smokes an 8 core processor while.OK, what else.Dual camera system always a nice feature.What else does it do support HDR new secondary frames the fastest sensor well?No.Well, the graphics are amazing.OK, so heres the set set dual 12, Mega Pixel rear cameras wow. Thats huge wide angle lens telephoto lens.1080 P HD video portrait mode.Gigabit class LTEZ faster than 4 G up to 512 Gigabyte of storage.Wow.Taylor this is pretty awesome phone different colors is pretty kind of funky there.Alright so lets take a look at how bout any fat special financing deals.Whats available here OK when we had?Be.New 6 months same as cash.Lets go back toBack to the home page, there and what else do we want to do?So what aboutBuying options.See what our options are for buying.OK, there, we go choose an iPhone you know what Ive gotta go all the way Im going to go for the X.Ask Max 6.5 inch holy smokes $54 a month my carrier is Sprint.I kinda like the space gray of course.No, I had my current phone is only 64 gig, which isnt bad but Im going to go with tuna 56 gig.Looks like a silly of the $6 more month.So this would be $60.33 for 24 months. I think Im currently paying.About.46 to 48 hours from my current phone, maybe a little bit less now. If I want to buy at holy cow. Its really expensive.1250 dollars.My current phone is on the lease. I cant exactly trade, it in because I dont own it.Interesting.Hell let lets look at what about extended warranties good stuff like thatcause that always increases.The payments with the payment options.Apple care plus coverage options sold separately.Lets see.Is Apple Eyecare is pretty good too? Sometimes it encompasses a little bit more than the standard warranty so lets see if I can cana navigate my way around here.See.So here support.No, its OK, so find out about your coverage. Apple care products. Lets see lets see what it cost.So this is to check my current support, I dont want that.Lets go back.Hell make it easy going back to their iPhone.Stick a look under here.OK.Looking at payment options so this is kind of a glance so.I wanted to add Apple care plus theft in law, so I assume if for some reason my phone was.Stolen or lost it.1499.For up to 24 months or $299.See here.So looks like about add about another $15 per month.Interesting lets make sure Im looking on wrong phone was about the XS Max in 256 gig.Now I think this is going to be a little bit different.So just the Apple care is 999. But if I edit theft and loss for another $5, which isn t a bad benefit were you talking about our phone thats 1250 dollars.Might be worth considering that.So thats not bad OK? What I want to do now is take a look at maybe Best Buy.Sams Club is see if they have any incentives, but the phone is so new that really doubt there are any incentives.Right now, I mean, if I really in a market for phone. I mean, the phone. The options in the specifications look awesome.Go back and look at the specs again alright so lets go on your iPhone do, do, do do.Access Max.Text back so sick of the text box.Surpasses the same little bit heavier 7.34 ounces 6.2 inches holy smokes.3.05 inch with that s a nice size phone see resolutions little bit better here.Contrast is the same.Sing.Through the church.So really the big differences come into play that come into play are right here.The size of the screen, the phone.Resolution is a little bit better, there really thats the big difference is the size.No.OK, when I stop this video and.",iPhone X’s Max,,,,,,

 Planning a trip to Vegas in a way back to the assignment OK. Were recording as you can see my bill is due but were on autopay so were good.
 Kind of expensive right 170 specs like yeah, my wife is on and we have other **** on it, but
 Remember, when phones were like cheap remember nights and weekends.
 I mean thats funny to me coz you know.
 Its like I am at anytime minutes. I cant call you till 8 anyway focus.
 And forgive me, I usually used. Verizon app and not the website. So let me figure it out. So lets shop now here thats probably good start.
 Brothers again.
 To work yes, so the first things I look for our size, both in.
 Now.
 The like.
 Actual size and then gigs Im currently rocking 256, which is more than enough.
 I dont think I could downgrade but I dont think I need to upgrade you know, obviously apps pictures of kids.
 You know my wife takes a ton.
 What else docs things like that?
 So yes, I gotta have at least 2256 and I have a ton left and every now and then Ill back it up to my external drive to my laptop.
 Sorry bout my voice as you can tell Im still sick. But Ive been sick. This entire thing. So you just think I sound like this.
 When to the doctor today and.
 Finally got some meds more meds in him anyway right so lets look at this one looks look at the access Max.
 So what we have here 256 alright I cannot do 6464 so 2 years ago.
 But but 512 is pretty ridiculous, too, so I would definitely go with the 256 so thats the first thing I look forward and then I look for like dimensions.
 Funny story I actually had a iPhone 6 S for the longest time because it fit perfectly in the Palm of my hand.
 Everyone give me **** about itcause. It was rose gold, which is a conversation starter but I finally upgraded.
 Cracked the screen, oh thats another thing I dont use cases.
 Never have I hope everyone will my wife makes fun of me, but
 Ive insurance really good insurance sorry my brothers keep blowing me up.
 So lets see if this one doesnt really.
 Say how big it is, but obviously I know its bigger.
 Who here we go there you go so 3.05 in width and .62 .62 so much like?
 You have big hands, but I mean, my thumb only go so far and I dont like making the screen smaller.
 All my other video I said, I always shop. Apple had a Droid. For like a day and was the worst day ever. Ill never go back so Im always an apple guy.
 Hi sorry about all the texts.
 But yeah, so I dont use cases I dont use pop socket so like Im hesitant to upgrade right now, just because.
 I like my current size, you know, mega pixels dont mean anything to me and and color kinda does it mean I would never get gold? Lets just growth?
 Have silver right now space cruise kinda cool.
 So thats what I look for first is size and then. After that, I am I look at like upgrade promotions you can see here.
 Trade in or upgrade today and get 100 off on us with slick trade and so thats kind of.
 A good deal and 52 Bucks, a month, see that seems so little, but 24 months I mean? What is that?
 Over a grand phones have gotten so crazy. These days, but I mean, you can do everything on him, so I guess Im not super upset.
 Sorry about all the texts I shouldve told him I was doing it video diary. So Ill look at that and then lets see lets go back.
 Nope.
 Oh here.
 And then this one Apple iPhone SC. I think this ones bigger. The Max looks smaller. Although I feel like Max would be bigger. I dont know lets.
 Oh, no this one is actually cheaper.
 So I think this is I dont know how Im sure they updated one thing and everyone went crazy 41s not bad?
 L and it s a lot smaller so.
 This might be the one when I am ready to upgrade you know, I could now I have it but.
 Im hesitant just because.
 You know phones are getting so big are plus I 1000 bucks. I may have to start using the case of this and then that s a whole mother message problems.
 To look at cases.
 Home screens, make the Difference Hill Machine.
 So I mean, who wireless charging that is pretty sweet glass allows to charge charges wow alright.
 Theyre selling me on it.
 Now I dont care about 8:12 bionic nobody knows what that even means.
 Then **** care about cameras both its funny. HDR really watch movies on my phone larger and deeper pictures.
 Boca affect I dont even know what Boca is but it sounds cool depth control, you have depth control.
 But really the most important high better at this up and get into 6 minutes and I know it.
 Only 10 the most important things to me in order would definitely be.
 Gigs.
 Which is a little bit more than size?
 And then probably color and promotion so I guess thats for things. I really want to upgrade my wife has the 10 when it first came out, but Im so much.
 But she need a new phone and its its ******** cool, but you know.
 Im not readycause I dont want to pop socket. I really dont use a casecause if I have to get a case them.
 Colombian Amazon forever.
 But this project is been cool. Im not trying to sum it up right now, just because I think I think I do need upgrade.
 Yeah.
 If and when I do upgrade I would do it online. I mean, theres no need to drive to the Verizon store and have some.
 Kid tell me what I already know plus with 2 kids. You know you gotta put in the car and then they want to touch everything will be buying.
 IPads that I dont need in the store +2 day shipping.
 So I do like this access that might be my next purchase. I think I got a bonus coming up in November so.
 So stay tuned and other projects over sorry about all the text but.
 This is a fun project.
 You know this is more thats more for another higher low video anyway. Alright Im done OK.

I tried to go through I get these email like promotions from credo.And um.I tried to go in through the.URL.From the email you know like when I click on it, and it takes me through for shopping but.Indie mower in D, Mo.WasntBut the website wouldnt load appropriately. I couldnt really do anything so Im at the basic front page of Crete, oh.And.The reason Im coming to create oh is that they?You know donate money to political causes and thats important to me, Ive wanted to be a create oh. I dont know subscriber or whatever for a long time.But I might have said this in a different video. John my husband is worried about the coverage and I think I recently learned that.ItsThey use the Verizon Network. So we would end up having the same coverage. So I am going to shut phones on credo, but my my thought.Is that Im not going to see the deals that are offered to me in those promo emails so well see so I want to upgrade my phone. I currently have a 5 ass.What I would do when I come to this website is?Shop.IPhones I specifically want an iPhone because Im used to an iPhone, I love iPhones.Um.So I dont know why its not doing what it needs to do.OK.So.Um so yeah, I have a 16 gig 5S.And what I want to do basically is go through and look at anything newer top priorities for me.Are.More gigs I would be happy, even with a 32 gig because I currently have 16 and my phone is just.Cant do anything.So it would be a complete bonus to.Get a phone that has 64 gigs or higher.So more storage and a decent monthly payment plan.Like this seems reasonable to me for this iPhone 7 it s a 32 gig for 18 a month.Um.So with the SC I can have even more storage 128 gigs and its the same price.And I do know from the promo emails, they sent that these numbers were much lower like half this amount.But um.I dont, its not important to me that to have the newest so this iPhone X isnt.Like Im not drawn in. I dont think Id paid twice as much to have the axe just because its the newest phone.Frankly, anything newer than my 5S is going to feel amazing.I know that some of these are bigger.I could stay with my same size. I think the 5S is one of the smaller ones or.Go bigger either way, doesnt matter to me, I care about um a good camera. I think they all have.Good cameras, but I am aware that the SC.Happens to be on par with some of the later generations like that, the camera is even better than the Sevens.The 6 is a miss Evans so I could be easily content with the sea even though its one of the older ones.Um.Especially since Im getting so much storage hear the 128 for 1870, so Im going to choose that.And.Looks like its loading.Um have to check my zip code. I know they cover me.Ive done this a few times.Mostly, Im just dreaming at this point. I gotta convince my husband. Hes too afraid to lose mountain coverage in the Rocky Mountains but?The other thing we do is we provide his parents, who live out in the country and Michigan. We provide them with a.A park.Um so they can access the internetcause otherwise, they dont.I think theyd have to have dial up or something really crazy like that.So we provide them a puck so if we switched from Verizon to create oh wed probably end up getting.His parents a cell phone, which would be there hot spot.But for now, Im just going to shop for one phone instead of.I guess my normal process would be my phone my husbands phone and a third phone for his parents.Um.But Im only going to tell you right now, what I want so.OK, so.OK, Im going to choose a plan so if this is just for me. For example, if I left at the Verizon Plan.And I were doing this on my own moving over to create oh this is what Im going to.Shop forPlans.Yeah, 3 gigs is fine for me, I might not even need that.I use data mostly for my son, sometimes for email when Im out and about but we theres no way we use 3 gigs in a month so.I dont think unless were on a trip or something.OK, so um.So this is the mobile protection.And the mobile protection provides stolen damage loss.Replace it for a non refundable deductible varies depending on the current retail price going to look at the details in the program guide.Taking a long time to load.Sorry. OK.Um program overview.So I like that.You could enroll in it later. You dont necessarily have to enroll when you first purchase.Oh yeah, you can enroll much later, as long as your phone is operational so thats cool. I like that.Los theft accidental damage.And then so I think the phone. I chose is 895 a month.2 claims in any 12 month period.That seems really good.Replacement deductible so.200 Bucks.OK.So yeah, and then I also like that, um.I wouldnt have to send it anywhere, so thats cool you could.Take it to a location if its available in your area.Replacement deductible 149 repair deductible.7450.To me that all seems really reasonable and I would probably pay for that I would get that service.Um.Is going to let me go back So what happens here?So Im at 9 minutes. I know the cost the cost matters.Easy filing claim being able to have it fixed locali.Number of claims allowed.And then the billing happens on my phone bill is nice.So I do appreciate their website gives you the answers to all of these.So.So I would probably.Go ahead and choose that.",1 of 2,,,,,,

Once Ive got it narrowed down to 2 or 3 that I think.Are the something I would buy then I would consult with my sister Sean?Or her friend, Dan.Dan actually has his own.Tech company in California so I would call him and.Discuss what?Im looking at an end or perhaps even just email him.Cinnamon even shoot him, an email with some links to the 2 or 3 that Im interested in and also ask him that if he has some.Other better recommendation to add that and why and then he would tell me.Ive always consulted with him before I purchased a computer anyway. Thats pretty much how it would be done. Then I would work once Ive decided on which one I want.Then I would find the very absolute lowest best price.And provided I can see you know all the reasons for getting that depending on which credit card big step dad and.Um.Shipping if I can pick it up in store if it can be done locally here like for instance.If I decide to buy it at Best Buy or Office Depot or RC Willey If I can buy it online.Online to get the membership rewards points and then actually go pick it up in the store thats my preference.Im not a huge fan of the shipping to the door. But I will do that. When thats the only option thats available.And really basically thats all that would go into it after new technology.

I dont have my credit card with me. Nor my going to enter that so you guys could see it so.Please forgive me, but this is what I would do I would kinda Google around and look at features that I wanted and then narrow it down?And look up by features and price to whoever selling it for the cheapest.

I love it. Im as I mentioned before I think its totally cool that I can print from my phone.And I want another one just like it for the office where.Baron I work for it for the sword fighting school. Sorry Im having a hard time speaking and so the very first thing I do, Ill admit?Im not a really good researcher so Google is my best friend.And what am I doing I will go to my Google and Ill type in as close to what I want.As I as I know so I know I want it to be wireless so Im going to look for the best.Wireless.Office printers.And first one, that comes out and I wanted to be all in one, I know that I want to scanner. I want to call pure.On a printer. I want it to be wireless fax would be OK but not necessarily something to click on the first.Suggestion it gives me but the the all in ones in 2018 that are wireless. I wait for it to come up.And the first thing Im going to do is Im going to scroll through the pictures why I dont know.Said This is what I always do you like the pictures I like to look at the overall prices.So were looking probably at about $200 it looks like.So now I have a price range. Here s a really expensive one for 300 but everything else was right around $200.So then I dont click on the ads and the reason I dont is because since II do own a small business. I know those ads cost you money.And when somebody clicks on it, and theyre great if thats the only link I have. But I know theres more for this.And I want to call somebody money because then theyll charge more for their their products and Im GP. I want stuff cheap.So next in Google theres usually this little blurb like saying, um for some company and so this. This is kind of what I want I want to list that I can compare.And these are the topics by Tech Radar which Ive used before simply through this way. I did nothing I know about any other.Through any other Avenue other than Google so Im going to click on this.And Im going to scan down here.And look at each one this more expensive. One says is a good long term investment print copy scan cheap to run.But it says it has limited features compared to some.That is cheap to run so the next one.Im gonna look at is this cannon.Now it looks so its tricky to set up. Im kind of patient when it comes to set up when it comes to performance not so much.But set up Im willing to do what it takes.But its kinda.Apparently, a lower price.And its kind of sleek looking kind of like it.OK, so Im going to look at a couple more this is the envy.Hello.Smart phone support well, I didnt know to ask for that so.Im gonna have to look for thatcause thats definitely something I want.Lots of features, including smart phone support OK, so I had all of them. This one caught my eyecause. I definitely want the whole be able to print from my phone thing thats just too cool.And.This one this one looks huge to me, I dont have that much room in my little office at the gym.At this .5 engine so thats too big right off the bat. I dont like it.In a scroll past it.And then theres this one. Its an all in one this wants it looks like HPs have smart phones support. Im going to.Look at some HPs I think.OK is in so this one, though the NBA it said was kinda cheap.But Im sorry I was looking at the the words.It looks like this one is a little cheaper.Um Oh, but it says theres no wireless printing.OK.But have smart phones support.So now I have a question.I want to know.What does wireless smart phone support?Maps.I mean in a printer. I think I know what it means but I want to be sure.And I cant type.Alright.No no no no what does wireless?Set an alarm phone.Support.There we go.Something to scroll through here and see if it means what I think it means.Yeah, I think it does, I see this mobile printing from HP with easy wireless printing from your iPad iPhone.Im assuming blah blah blahcause I have an Android.OK.OK, so now that I think I know what I already knew.Um.Now Im thinking I wanna eat one in a HP. And yes, I know the ranks are more expensive, but its what I want.So Im gonna look at.Comparing.Panel scroll past the ads.I think I would want an independent person rather than Hewlett-Packard.Lets see.Mem.Not seeing anything here that really like.Trips my trigger.So um.Probably what Ill do.Is all Im going to go to this um HP store?His right now, what I want to do is see prices. I want to see like how much that envy costs.And if its within that $200 then honestly what Ill do is Ill go to office Max.And Ill Ill see if I cant handle it and look at it.And touch it and make sure that its not too big that its.That, it does what I wanted to do that. Its cartridges are so far out price wise that II cant afford to print anything.M.And if all that checks out, then Ill compare prices if its cheaper at office. Max, which is right down the street from me.Ill buy it from therecause I would like to have it.Rather than wait for it.But if its cheaper online then I will search and see if its on Amazon.com and see if I can get it cheaper.Then, on a HPs website.So.Wow, OK that thats kind of like not what I want there.Lets see.Lets look at HP store.And frankly.I might just go to Amazon.com anyway.But I give this one more shot.And I have prime so I wouldnt have to wait that long.See printers.",Its a little over the 10 minutes....please let me know if I need to redo it!,,,,,,

They actually today is rough checking it out, butOne of the things Ive been thinking about getting a new TV actually so if you needs that Im kind of looking at.Im just going to kind of walk through and browse physical few ways. I do this when Im looking at a big purchase.Like to go out to the store just look and see what Im buying one putting in a decent amount of money down.Early like to know what Im what Im getting so yeah, so anyway, Im gonna kinda just walked through here and see what we can find.So some things that Im looking forward the ticket price for one, but Im also looking for a kind of want to get.TV has a lot of newer features that I can connect to the Internet and things like that, so lets just kind of take a look.As Im working you know immediately. Im seeing these and Im really. Im really amazed at how cheap there.So so for instance, this filament TV is a smart TV. Its only $300 but Im not real familiar with element?Probably look into that a little more my wife actually has some special needs because she had some hearing issues.So Im really looking for something that has blue tooth as well so that I can connect it to like headphones or something for her.So thats something else, Im gonna be looking forward to so but this one really caught my eye just because of the low price.These other ones were here are also reasonable but there not smart TV so Im going to keep looking a little bit.Ive heard some good things. This is the Roku TV and Ive heard some good things about that. Just reading online, too, so that might be an option to look into.Right now, I just kind of want to get an idea you know, and just look at some ofem.And then Ill probably do a little kind of slow decision make it stop the bleed do some online research. You know its going to look into the product.A little bit before I make a decision so Im not in a rush at the TV I have is fine. Its still working great.Its maybe 5 years old, 6 years old, so its still got some life love.Missy really this is not bad, either coz this is a Phillips. It s a smart TV and its pretty reasonably priced also so.That I would probably be more likely to go with that one. Samsung is another brand. Id really I trust also LG.Which is what I have now so in these really arent terribly high pretty good prices? I think so.Now were getting into this seriously. I definitely cool stuff over here, which Im probably a little out of my price range.This phone is really cool, it at the curb screen, which is the new translator is not that expensive it is.Cool. I mean when I look at these I think maybe I maybe I could talk myself into getting one of these just because it is so much better picture quality.I notice this one right here is going to rollback tag on it, so.It s a better price I guess it s a 65 inch pretty impressive. So I mean, I might be talked into that s a good deal.A lot of TV.So the other thing I mentioned I was kinda looking for is like Bluetooth adaptability, which I think most TVs nowadays havecause. I really like to connect it to Alexa.Maybe to some Bluetooth headphones, so thats something Im going to kind of look at next.So, like this Phillips I was just showing you has the wireless lane and for streaming and I guess most of them probably have that, too, so you can connect.Connect to your Wi-Fi. This is cool. Its got the built in Chrome cast. So I guess just a lots happened in the last 56 years since I bought a TV.Technology was pretty cool stuff. I really like the curve screen. Thats really cool. Anyway to it, and I didnt spend a real long time here.This is a smaller Walmart stores, so theres not as much selection and Ive got some other stores, I.Might as well figure electronics places, but this was an easy stop for a night with thing I guess. I like best about Walmart is their prices in their return policy is really good so.Good place to start but yeah, I mean, I probably look online like on Amazon and stuff to see if I could get a good deal that way.Price deal shoppers so I didnt really see a lot about Bluetooth on any of these so that would probably be something else that I would look into online so.Research is that something I really want to have the ability for that, so anyway. Thats all I got for tonight.Hope that was informative enough thanks.",Looking for a new TV,,,,,,

 A TV right now, its an 8 year old gonna be 52 inch Phillips. Its been a wonderful TVLED.
 Has served us very well continues to work well but were looking at possibly going to something bigger because we entertain.
 Meaning something thats got some higher definition, then what we have think we have a 1080 pixel on this one so.
 So I got my trusty asus laptop out here to help me out. Ive made a bunch of notes about the things that arm.
 That are important to me that I think are important to me about a smart TV. What size what is the technology theyve got this now 4 K and?
 Ultra high definition and So what are the pics cells So what are the speed refresh rates? I dont even know if thats?
 Still, a good thing to look at. Um reputation absolutely. Warranty and support are very important. 61 years old.
 Theres lots of stuff that I dont know out there but I try to stay up with it so.
 You know where to buy at store versus online. You know probably want to see it touch it rather than just have this thing show up.
 Although although I will say that I bought the last one.
 On line went to Sams and have them deliver it. So so Im not 100% sure about that one.
 Price you know, were looking at 1015, 100 be a statics. You know how does the TV look? How does it?
 Work in fact, is Samsung que Le gall show you that in a second delivery versus pick up. Weve got an SUV so we can put that in there.
 Installation is not a concern. I can hook it up to all the devices and after playing in bands for years Im pretty good at connecting things.
 What kind of imports curved versus flat so theres my little list that I made up ahead of time?
 And so then I started going on line to take a look at whats out there and so I have?
 Always relied on CNET to give me good advice about computers. Cameras phones technology in general. I dont think that they are biased.
 Towards any brand from what Ive been able to see. And so I can go through here and and take a look at the various TV.
 Now also what I like about CNET is that they also give me an idea what Im looking out.
 At as far as the prices and where I can get it, so thats thats one place that I will.
 Definitely take a look at this just to make sure that I understand you know whats whats important? Whats doing well with.
 Isnt doing well and then another place that I that I would go to is Best? Buy have bought a lot of stuff at Best Buy over the years.
 And with the geek squad. Weve always had really good support from them. If we needed to have something exchanged.
 Not a lot of problems, the quality of their service and their reputation in the market and with us is very good so.
 Best Buy is a very strong contender for where we actually buy this in there pretty good at an arena what we can find online too so.
 I will go through.
 Take a look at what kind of specials. They have, I can go right around the corner there only about 3 miles?
 From the house, so I can walk in and take a look at these and talk to people there is well thats important to me.
 Im not sure about this curve versus flat things so you know that would be a great item to look up here and I will look up.
 As I was going through and preparing for this. I was looking at the Samsung. I mean, this is things a monster 75.
 75 inches, 1500, so its right at the top end of our of our budget and 75 inches. I dont know Im going to feel like Im.
 Rate in the game right there, so could be a little scary, but the thats thats the way that I would approach this you know.
 My wife leaves these kinds of things up to me.
 Ill probably talk to my daughters is well into friends that have new TVs, and who are techies more techie than I am.
 And just get their their ideas, you know when you buy. Something like a television youre looking at you like the one that I have right now.
 8 years that weve had this one and depending on you know when we pulled the trigger. I think Christmas will be.
 Christmas will be 9 years that we would have had that TV. So thats you know this is an investment.
 I dont look at this is just a throwaway appliance like a phone. 2 years and then you know youre pretty much forced to get the next one.
 So when I look at technology and I dont care whether you know in the kitchen were looking at appliances and.
 The old TV in such or the new stuff that we have debose. Weve had for about 7 or 8 years. You can see it scuffed up pretty good.
 Man, its its an investment. It works, great same thing with the Amazon Dot. Weve had that for a couple years.
 So you know, these things are important to us that we get Quality Inn, something thats going to last us for years.
 We are not a throwaway household so those are some of the ideas that that go through my mind when Im getting ready to make a purchase like this.
 So thats it, theres your video.",The Process to Buy a Television,,,,,,

 So lets see what the pricing is open right now goal is $59 on Amazon Bullets, even find discount.
 So looking for these.
 **** teen multi colors.
 B****
 OK.
 Cancel the same.
 200 Bucks for.
 196. 44.
 Good deal.
 So it looks to me like it.
 What is it?
 3 cents cheaper on Amazon for a for pack and I bet its.
 A number of cents cheaper for just one.
 Swell.
 So I know they have them on the shelf at Home Depot. If I was in a big rush OK, I save.
 99 cents per bulb if I buy them individually by buying Amazon.
 I dont wanna help.
 Ive had these bulbs, so I probably wouldnt get the warranty. If it were my first time and I was buying four. And I was buying
 $200 dollars worth of light bulbs.
 Id probably look for somewhere that could offer me a warranty.
 For 2 to 4 years for hopefully under $10.
 But because Ive had them. Im not really too worried about that. It doesnt look like Amazon offers that.
 Home Depot might but like I said, I just dont care. So I would say that if I was ready to go.
 Want to buy some life X?
 I would probably be tapping.
 Add the card right about now.

 Around the House Alright so my old system is the box is a little bit everywhere trying to organize them.
 My new system is to try to keep box. We are weak. We do 2, maybe a month at the most.
 And then pull up all the important information in the warranties registration. All that stuff, and throw it in.
 While.
 Now, my filing Cabinet is currently buried and quite frankly its just a bunch of brochures manuals inside of a folder inside of a Cabinet, which is buried in the back of a heat.
 On a carpet so you need to see all that stuff, but folder of manuals and warranties and what not.
 And little bit of the old system to me go down here to the classic junk drawer. Hey look, its my new phone is back.
 I threw some SIM cards and Little Doodads warranty information.
 Remind me next got an award theres this box movies. Get rid of fruit that look here s a recycling.
 And even see the box from my old cell phone. I have spent better placed to help move Motorola. So Im getting rid of the old stuff.
 Working really doing well and then who are we gonna have fun were going up that ladder.
 Right there, we turn on the light to get ready.","I started keeping boxes when I bought my home and started outfitting it. It quickly got overwhelming. Then I stopped keeping them all and started just keeping boxes for expensive things or things I felt would break at some point (ie cell phones, printers, headphones), eventually that became overwhelming. I now try to hold on the the boxes for a month or less, then just the paperwork if it seems worthwhile.",,"If something goes wrong with the item or I need to update it (setting timers, settings on complex electronics). Honestly the more I explain myself the more I feel like a low level hoarder because i really rarely go in the cabinet (maybe 4-5 times a year)",,,,

 I just turned on my way. There lets try again.
 There we go Welcome to the attic and it looks like dust blowing around.
 So Hey, you can see, theres all sorts of things we have the TV box and back locks.
 Brokers for saying this new spring about the home. Do that thing a person with a duplex.
 Sometimes, like thermostats, USB powered doing smart thing to happen up my thermostat so smart so.
 Yeah, that controls itself and try to my thermostat down here.
 Right thats pulled says its $200 for 4 bulb mark sensitive box right smart outlet because the people who move in next dont want that.
 Is OK will just pull it out and put it back in the box and keep it later?
 Yeah, those are the boxes are the things I need to keep thats where I want to go out of the attic.
 I suppose when I moved out probably take all the warranty step on those boxes.
 If American friends back in, then owned I will throw away the boxes coz but his name matches at the time right right talk to you later.","I know what you are thinking. Well maybe. My guess is either wow thats a lot of dust, which I agree with. Or, so is it worth it to save them? 98% of the time no. The product either works fine, or at least works fine I till the warranty expires. Even in the case it breaks while the warranty is in force, I have found the internet is the best way to find the information and contact the company, then they dont usually even want you to sent the box. As I write this I realize how futile it is to save this stuff. Maybe I should just start taking pictures of the stuff that matters and save it in its own album online....",,"I thought a bit more about it. The TV box is handy for moving and storage of a 55"" TV so that will for sure stay. The rest of the stuff will probably slowly go away. I prefer not to fill up space with nonsense, but for some reason have the hardest time tossing the packaging to expensive electronics... Weird",Its stuff I had forgotten about until you asked! Now that I know its there... I will probably leave it where it is for now. At some point Ill get antsy and figure it out ;),,,
