Let me provide a little background and then I’ll respond to the points you brought up. ***I apologize in advance for how long this is going to be.***

I started using a Mac in 2009 on Snow Leopard. I’m obviously not a true “long-time Mac user” but I was born in 1987 so I’d say I’m a long-time Mac user since I wasn’t really using computers for much before about the early to mid 2000s. I got my first iPhone a couple years before that with the 3GS. When I started on iOS I was actually still a Yahoo user but switched to Gmail not too long after that. The only Android device I’ve ever owned was an HTC 10 and I kept it for about 4 months before selling it and switching back to iOS. I couldn’t stand it so much that I actually lost a few hundred bucks in the process to switch back so soon. I liked/appreciated certain aspects of Android at the time, but there were some things about it that drove me nuts, most of which are fixed now.

I know privacy is a main reason people use Apple over Google, and I used to be obsessed with privacy and at one point even tried getting rid of anything Google. Switched to iCloud for everything including email, used all Apple apps, and used DuckDuckGo for search. The benefits of the AI on Google’s services just made my life easier so I guess I caved in a way.

Now I’ll talk about the services and apps:

—

**Apple Music:**

I used Apple Music for a few months after Rdio shut down before switching to Spotify and still will go back from time to time for a single month just to see how it has improved. I don’t remember the timing of the Rdio acquisition by Pandora, but if that happened after Apple Music first came out I do remember signing up for the trial as soon as it came out. I also used iTunes Match along-side Spotify for a while before using Google Play for the free song matching and uploads. I actually have a personal Apple Music subscription right now because of the whole Apple/Spotify fiasco. I wanted to see how it is now with the new browse screen and since I do prefer Apple’s artist payout model. There are some things I much prefer on Apple Music. If the two services could be combined that would be ideal. I love Apple Music’s lyrics and the way the handle the queue. I wish both services had queues like Rdio had where it synced across devices and where I could queue up an album for later and still put the album or playlist I’m currently listening to on repeat in a silo of sorts.   
I have several issues with Apple Music that just aren’t as good as Spotify:  


1. No Spotify Connect type feature. This is huge for me, especially when playing music to a smart speaker. When I start playing music on a smart speaker I don’t want my music playing to be locked down to voice only (or just airplay). I want to be able to use my phone as a remote. Also frequently listen to music from my Mac and want to pick up where I left off when leaving the office. Being able to just take over my session is amazing.
2. I’m not a big fan in general of Apple’s curation and curators. I haven’t found any curator with remotely the same taste as me. Spotify’s blend of real curation and AI curation just wins for me. I largely rely on Discover Weekly and Release Radar to find new music I like and I rarely am presented with songs or playlists that don’t fit my taste.
3. This will probably be a non-issue in iOS 13, but man that bright white interface is terrible on the eyes.

**Apple Maps:**

I used Apple Maps exclusively for a while after it came out and switched back for a while when I got a CarPlay receiver in my car since it didn’t support Google Maps. Apple Maps has gotten much better over time, but Google Maps is just way more developed. Apple relies on Yelp which I just can’t get into. I hate that when I want to find out more information about a business it has to open an external app to get that info. Google Maps is just a much better interface when it comes to interacting with a business. Reviews, pictures, street view, business walkthroughs, recommendations, lists, integrated location sharing, tracking so you can look at your travel history, etc. Google Maps just does everything I want it to do better or more fully than Apple does. I get that most people don’t like Google knowing everything I just listed, especially the location stuff, but for me the benefits outweigh the costs. Plus you have to enable the background location tracking stuff manually so most people probably don’t even have that turned on.

—

**Safari:**

I agree for the most part that Safari is a much cleaner and less bloated browser. Performance is certainly better *most* of the time on Mac. On iOS it’s obviously better because of the integration stuff like auto-fill of security code texts and stuff like that. And Chrome can’t use its own engine so only Safari gets all the benefits with performance. I go back and forth between Safari and Chrome from time to time and if I switch on my Mac I switch on iOS because tab and history sync are really important for me. Chrome is better at some things - tab management and sync have just been more consistent in my usage. Safari is better at basic browsing and performance. Right now I use Safari. Chrome is certainly more capable for power users and most sites now use Chrome as the development standard so there are big benefits there.

—

**Gmail and related Google apps:**  
You didn’t mention email, contacts, and calendars but I’ll throw this in just because it’s important to me.  
I think Apple does a great job with iCloud contacts and calendars. In fact, I used iCloud for that for a long time until I started using the Gmail web interface more and needed contacts and calendars to sync with it.  
I used iCloud Mail for a while when it came out and replaced MobileMe. I also tried MobileMe for a short period of time even before iCloud Mail came out. A few years back I even migrated all of my Gmail history into iCloud. I just missed Gmail’s power user features in the end and came crawling back.

I love labels in Gmail. For work with G Suite this is especially important for me. When emails come in, I have rules set up to automatically add the label for company domain addresses. This makes it really easy to identify which customer an email is coming in for and also makes it easier to archive because I don’t have to manually move into a certain folder when I’m done with it and want to file it. I also frequently discuss multiple customers in a single email thread with a vendor, so having the ability to tag with multiple customers has many benefits.  
The recent improvements utilizing AI in Gmail are pretty damn helpful too. Autocompletion of sentences that learns how you speak, suggested replies, nudges for follow-up emails, etc. Google is killing it when it comes to putting AI to good use.

Also, nothing even touches their search. Apple Mail uses Spotlight and while Spotlight used to be quite good I’ve had many issues with in the past few years where even reindexing didn’t help. Server-side search is just better in every way. I’m also not sure how I could live without Gmail’s keyboard shortcuts at this point.  
Oh and Google calendar integration is super nice too. In G Suite, for example, I have a GoToMeeting add-on installed so I can quickly add conferencing information to a calendar invite without having to open the actual GoToMeeting app.

Everything I just listed is only fully integrated to iOS if I use Google’s official apps. Doing this on Android would just make all of this more native.

Ok I think that about sums it up. Sorry for such a long post. I just wanted to make sure you understood that I’m not some ignorant user that has been locked into the Google ecosystem and hasn’t looked away. I could get into iCloud Photos vs. Google Photos and get into assistants, but then I’d be borderline getting into book territory .",3

Apple Inc.’s AAPL -0.91% close-knit industrial design team is undergoing its most pronounced turnover in decades, marking a changing of the guard for the famed group that has defined the tech giant’s aesthetic and spearheaded the development of products including the iPhone.

Rico Zorkendorfer and Daniele De Iuliis, who together have more than 35 years of experience at Apple, decided to leave the company recently, people familiar with the departures said. Another member of the team with a decade of experience, Julian Hönig, plans to leave in the coming months, people familiar with his plans said.

Mr. Zorkendorfer said he was taking a break from his professional life to spend time with his family, adding that he felt privileged to work on Apple’s design team. Mr. De Iuliis didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Hönig declined to comment.

The departures of members of the core design team that revived Apple in the 2000s and did the work behind the iPhone, iPad and watch come amid a pause in new products, as the company emphasizes new subscription services this year instead of new gadgets amid slowing iPhone sales. It also follows chief designer Jony Ive’s resumption a little over a year ago of day-to-day oversight for the industrial design group.

The roughly two-dozen person team known internally as ID is responsible for establishing the look and feel of all of Apple’s products, including the iPhone, one of the most successful products of all time. The tech giant has replenished its design ranks in recent years, adding creatives from apparel company Nike Inc., independent studios and design schools. Recent hires will assume more responsibility for product development as veterans leave.

“This group is all-powerful in Apple,” said Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to Apple analysis. “Industrial designers have the final say over the user experience found with Apple devices, and they really do work like a family in a way. No one would argue, though, that new blood is a bad thing.”

Mr. Cybart said a change in the team’s composition makes sense as Apple shifts from designing Macs and iPhones to new projects in areas such as augmented reality and autonomous vehicles.

Apple is battling an abrupt downturn in its iPhone business that triggered the first decline in revenue and profit for a holiday quarter in over a decade. In March, the company announced new subscription services for TV shows, videogames and magazines—sales of which it hopes will offset the iPhone slowdown. Though it refreshed its core iPhone, Mac, iPad and smartwatch product lines last year, its most recent new product releases were the HomePod smart speaker in 2017 and its AirPods wireless earbuds in 2016.

The ID group was key to resurrecting Apple’s business after co-founder Steve Jobs returned in 1997. The small team led by Mr. Ive collaborated to design the candy-colored iMac that quickly became the best-selling computer in the U.S. and followed up on that with a string of design hits that defined the mobile computing era.

Mr. Jobs put the design group at the nexus of Apple’s product development process and lavished attention on the team, visiting it almost daily to see its latest work on new products. The combination of the ID team’s elevated status inside Apple and Mr. Jobs’s treatment helped create a group that worked and socialized together, becoming so tight that only a few members of the team left in more than a decade, according to some of these people.

Stock grants made the designers millionaires as Apple became the world’s most valuable company. Many were able to afford second and even third homes.

A group that once thrived on the resources provided by Apple and had worried that their career prospects would be less promising if they left the company started to disband, people familiar with the team said. Among the first to peel away were Danny Coster, who joined GoPro Inc. in 2016, and Christopher Stringer, who left in 2017 for a professional break and later launched a Los Angeles-based audio startup that is in stealth mode.

Those departures coincided with Mr. Ive stepping back from day-to-day oversight of ID in 2015. Instead of spending time in the design studio, he devoted much of his attention to designing Apple’s new campus, which opened its doors in 2017. Richard Howarth, a vice president, led the group until Mr. Ive returned in December 2017.

The departures of Messrs. Zorkendorfer and De Iuliis signal new life for the ID team.

“We have incredible new designers—a new generation,” Mr. Zorkendorfer said. “What we’ve been able to do the last few decades will continue. The talent is there.”",1

As I'm sure you know, Google Pixel is not AOSP. If we're being super anal, your question to begin with is thus comparing iPhone the-hardware-and-OS-together, to Android just-the-OS, and you're nitpicking it that way. The WHOLE POINT about Android is that it's a platform open to OEMs to build on, and provide different features for different people that want different things at different price points. No you obviously can't get everything I listed in one phone, but everything I listed exists on Android powered phones and not on iPhone/iOS powered phones. That is what ""Android can do"". If you exclude what capabilities Android OEMs give their phones, then the question to begin with is non-answerable because Android as a product does not exist in a vacuum.

As far as torrenting goes, in the last few years I have gone on several multi-month, multi-country holidays and have been able to do so without any device other than my phone. There are some TV shows and sports I like to keep up with and in many cases while travelling, there is no realistic way for me to ""legally"" watch these in any practical manner. This is the one and only reason that torrenting on Android is valuable to me. But if I had iPhone, I would now have to lug my laptop around with me (for that function and several others that my Android phone can do without a laptop but an iPhone can't), or come home from say a four month trip with 16 weeks worth of TV shows and sports to catch up on. Is it a big deal missing some TV? No, not really. But it's a capability that Android gives me so I might as well use it, and travelling for extended periods without needing a laptop or any other device because it all works on my phone *is* amazing and is a big deal to me. I'm quite certain you don't care and you seem to get some self-gratification with taking the high-road on being an ""adult"", but if you're asking the general question ""what can android do that iPhone can't"", then this is in that list, whether you or I find it valuable or not. I don't care for Gear VR, because I have PC VR, but I put it in the list because the question is not about me, it's objectively about Android vs iPhone, not my subjective interests.

I already said iPhone is getting super wide angle soon, and of course Apple will have a response for the night photos as well, Siri will improve, etc etc etc. But that all goes back to my original comment about constantly moving goal posts.

2) Yes you could, but the point is - no Android user ever says ""what can iPhone do that Android can't"", only iPhone users use this as a way to dismiss Android. ***Just like you have exactly done now***, instead of just taking the answer at face value, you go and conveniently rationalise away almost everything that Android can do that iPhone can't. So you're ***never asking the question in good faith to begin with***, only as a way to be dismissive in the most shorthanded way possible. That's what is shitty about every time an iPhone user says that question.

You rationalise several times with ""***I*** don't need this feature"". But that's exactly what I said, maybe you don't use these features, but other people do, and you're asking the general question about comparing the two platforms, when in fact what you're really just saying is ""Whatever Android can do that iPhone can't do, I'm personally not interested and I don't care."" You also mention ""when I asked that question Android didn't have it"" - just as per my moving goal posts remark.

If you want to phrase your question as ""what can &lt;general operating system open to all manufacturers&gt; do, that &lt;specific hardware device from single manufacturer&gt; can't do?"" and then get all uppity when the answer involves general comparisons, then you're the one being disingenuous in the first place.

If I said ""What can Windows Mobile do that Samsung Galaxy S can't"", I would fully expect the answer to involve all the many things that Windows Mobile powered phones can do, whether they are specific to an individual hardware manufacturer or part of the OS itself. ***Because*** if I'm asking that question *in good faith*, then I genuinely want to be informed of all the features and options that Windows Mobile phones gives me that Android phones don't. When I ask that question, I obviously know there is no such thing as a reference ""Windows Mobile Phone"" that exists as a specific comparison.",4

Well, not the gear, lol. I go used, so my stuff is old, around 2011/2012. iMac, MacBook Pro, iPad Air original, iPhone 4s (just now got a 6 16gb, hoping to find and settle a while with a 6sPlus 128gb). Stuff I got dirt cheap, barter, etc. Happy. I do incremental upgrades and max out the Macs as I can afford. I love the ecosystem and software as well. Partly because I have disabilities but am still reasonably physically active and productive and helpful to my community. Partly because I’m finally doing the things I’ve been dreaming to do for years which I couldn’t truly achieve with PC/Windows. Stuff like continuity, useful built-in utilities (could Notes be better? Sure), handing off, connectivity (think Bluetooth hearing aids and all kinds of other accessibility features) easy setup, rare problems (and I mean VERY RARE, plus nothing I couldn’t solve within the hour including web research), cloud services, keychain, etc. Got a good used similar era 2tb Airport Time Capsule, nice network. Oh plus the ability to bootcamp Windows 7 in a separate partition on both my Macs and use whenever I need to, typically to help other folks troubleshoot pc issues or to carry out the rare task that absolutely requires Windows. My experience with Apple customer support, even for out-of-warranty stuff, has been consistently awesome. 

Only new Apple devices I have are TV 4K I got for $175 on sale and a Nike+ 42mm S3 cellular Watch + a few new accessories I couldn’t pass up at $175 (friend got it as a work award but wears a really nice S4, so he sold the S3 to me). Sweet that it just connects and works with everything I have. The Taptic feedback on my wrist is the #1 reason for the watch, in my book. Along with health and sleep tracking, ability to take a quick look at the most important items or do the most basic things on my wrist, like at times when using the iPhone is just not practical or possible (hey, I’m a discombobulated guy so I sometimes forget it when I go outside around the house. Now, I just leave it plugged in at my desk, do my thing around the house-came in REAL handy while shoveling 3’ snow outside a little while ago-and then just take it with me whenever I actually go somewhere). I’m actually using the data that I’m collecting on my health and sleep in my current effort to exercise, work with my doctor, eat right and get in better shape now that I’m in middle age. Love music...big in my life and Apple Music has been great too.

I switched from being hardcore PC/Windows three years ago and I regret not having done it earlier. Full disclosure: have owned an iPad since the first week iPad 1st gen came out. Being a full PC guy for life (C64, TRS-80, 8088 clones on up), I had always dreamed of a good slate. I dabbled with different PC/slate devices through the 90s and early 00s that just never could cut it but all that time I laughed at Apple‘s concept of an iPad. During that first week when it came out, I decided to humor myself by going into the Arden Fair mall Apple Store in Sacramento to get my hands on an iPad to play with and laugh at the stupid toy. I saw the iPhones, the Macs, the MacBooks, but none of that interested me. I was still of that caveman mindset that Apple/Mac was just that...weird little world. Anyway, I focused on the iPad. After an hour, I walked out of the store with the top-of-the-line model iPad and I’ve been impressed with and have use iPad for mobile since then. Gave up on my EVO 4G (loved that phone) after HTC stopped supporting it in 10 months and got an iPhone 4s 16gb new in 2011. The rest is history. Haven’t found the need to switch over anything. Stuff just seems to work. Upgrade, sure.

I’ll never knock people for using Windows/PC, Google, Linux, tin cans with strings, or whatever. You use what works for YOU. Just strive to improve your gear and their housekeeping. And, so far, in over 3 years with old gear, Apple works quite well for me. I spend FAR less time screwing around with getting the gear and software to work and MORE time just getting on with more important things in my life. I swear, it’s been a revolution for me.",1

**Heart/Body/Nutrition apps**

I don't think Apple would add some of this stuff because they're not things that the Watch or the iPhone cover. A Heart app that encompasses Heart Rate and ECG makes sense because those are native functions of the Watch. I like Body and Nutrition apps in theory (well, Body less so because BMI isn't a great measurement), but they're reliant on third party apps and information, and I do not feel Apple would create dedicated apps to show off information that their hardware cannot natively provide. A Nutrition app would also then require Apple to maintain their own database of nutrition information or work with third party partners themselves, which creates more work and responsibility for them. If anything it would be a Health app that shows a selection of information that you choose, because the Health app and HealthKit already functions as a database for health data from both first party and third party sources.

**Activity Rings and Sleep app**

I'm hesitant on offering more rings to track, but at least there's an acknowledgement of potential overload by the concept limiting it to one new ring. Honestly most of those extra choices feels redundant (workout vs. exercise? steps vs. distance? There's a tremendous amount of overlap here). Additionally, something like sleep would not be offered if Apple cannot offer a way to measure this native to the Watch.

**Workout app**

Adding another tap before getting into a workout in the Workout app feels tedious. ""Near Me"" and ""Popular"" are good in theory, but I don't think people spontaneously decide what workout to do - they have an idea of what they'll do before they get to the point of working out. If anything, customization of workout selection should be limited to the Watch app on iPhone (like show these workouts at the top of the list or something). The workout metric screen might be too dense, especially on smaller Watch models. I don't think text size affects the information on the screen how it is currently, but making it smaller might not be the best move, especially with the setup in the concept possibly removing a metric line. I like the idea of offering complications, but I'm not sure if how it's presented is the best way of doing it.

**Control Center**

Further Control Center customization would be nice. Not sure if I would describe it as ""completely redesigned""

**Device Control**

This is needed, and it's something that Apple needs to be more consistent and uniform about. It's especially silly with stuff like iOS 12.2 showing what's playing on the Apple TV as a Now Playing widget on the lock screen; from here I can tell my Watch to pause or resume, and it will do that, but if I specifically tell my Watch ""pause the Apple TV"", it seemingly can't.

**Watch Faces; Home Screen; Calculator, Calendar, Notes, Home, Photos, Books, Voice Memos apps**

Sure.

**Safari**

His reasoning in the video is ""why not?"" which isn't a good reason. ""Nice to have"" isn't necessarily a good reason to offer this either. On one hand, the Watch obviously already can support for this and can navigate web pages. But I don't think it's a headache that Apple necessarily wants to deal with it. Apple's apps on the Apple Watch are all pretty defined and relatively narrow in scope, because trying to do too much can lead to a bad experience and create unreasonable expectations and what you should be able to do on the Watch. Enabling a user to view the whole web creates a whole another set of questions to consider: ""what should be the browsing experience be like on the Watch? how should websites be displayed? what functions should be possible and not be possible?"" His example of reading some headlines in the news is already possible via the News app.

**Shortcuts app**

Yeah, it was a bummer that they removed the watchOS app when Workflow officially became Shortcuts. It needs to come back.",6

The Samsung Gear IconX (2016 model) runs circles around the current Galaxy Buds (2019 model). I own both, and here's my rundown: 

1. IconX does not require the app. The touch controls work without running Galaxy Gear, on all devices, PC, Linux laptop, Android, iOS, macOS. Play, Pause, Next Track, Start Workout, Ambient Sound all work from the buds themselves, even without pairing them to any other device. Galaxy Buds, do not.
2. The passive isolation works with a touch, and you can let go and still leave it running . Galaxy Buds *REQUIRES* the app to use this feature (and thus, Android only), and you have to hold your finger to the buds to keep it enabled. It doesn't stay on if you remove your finger from the bud.
3. IconX are waterproof. You can shower with them, swim with them. Galaxy Buds are not. 
4. IconX contain a built-in HRM, so you can use them for workouts. Galaxy Buds do not. 
5. IconX has 4GB of onboard storage, so you can load them up with podcasts, music, white/pink noise, audiobooks or whatever else you want. Galaxy Buds do not. 

The downside of IconX? 45 minutes runtime when streaming, 3-4 hours when playing audio directly from the buds local storage (not paired to any device)

Galaxy Buds have stellar battery life. I've streamed an entire day of music (6+ hours) while working, and they still kept going. That's an amazing improvement. 

But, without the app running on an Android device *AND* the buds paired directly to that Android device, you can't control *ANYTHING* on the buds, other than Pause and Next Track. 

You can't control volume up/down, you can't control ambient passthrough, you can't control anything. It's *INCREDIBLY* annoying to have someone walk up to you to talk to you, and have to pry out the buds to hear them, vs. the IconX, where you can tap and hold, enable ambient passthrough and have a conversation. Same with turning down volume. 

The IconX and the Galaxy Buds are not even in the same class as each other. One is an SUV, the other is a coupe. Completely different purposes and target markets, but they were marketed as the 'next generation earbuds'. 

They're not.

But the AirPods and AirPods 2? They look so absoutely ridiculous, I don't care if they have 3 days of battery life and telepathic ambient noise reduction, I'll never be caught wearing those in my ears. 

The whole design looks like a pathetic afterthought of the previous generation 'wired' buds, that were rushed to market because they didn't invest enough design time before they'd lose market share to the other competing offerings at the time.

It feels like someone had to make a jugement call to halt production, and spin up new facilities to manufacture new AirPod bud designs, or just take the old shell, cut off the wire, cap it off, slap in some new electronics and call it a 'new' design.

Steve Jobs would vomit if he saw the state of the current Apple portfolio, and he'd be justified in doing so. Walk into any Apple store, and it's a distracting, confusing disaster of products. 5 different iPad models, 4-5 different iPhone models, cases and dongles for days line the walls. 

It's a nightmare, and these buds are a clear, shining example of that failure.",4

Fair enough. And I believe the complete opposite. Whether negatively or positively, the MFi program ***exists*** to matter. At least to Apple. It exists to matter to their deep pockets, a product of the very large Apple accessories market. 

&gt; It was useless for the iPhone as its first and foremost a mobile in your pocket device. In other words the iPhone isn’t a game console that you sit in a chair and rock out to a game.

I fundamentally disagree that a platform that evolved based upon how customizable and modular it was compared to its previous contempararies which were very limited in their capabilities is unable to adapt in a functionality similar to that of a market that it for all intents and purposes ate a huge chunk out of (mobile gaming pre phones).

Basically, I think phones are the perfect match for simple controllers for better experiences. Does it make the experiences slightly more complex? Sure. But not even so complex that the Apple crowd couldn't handle it. But Apple has never been historically ""pro"" gaming, so it's honestly no surprise that they completely ignore if not snuff the segment, they don't actually care about gaming. That's fine. I'm just making the argument that they could do better, and may have actively ""conspired"" against it with their MFi program.

&gt;The mobile phone’s entire game value (for now) is for when you are out and about and happen to have it with you. It’d be awfully annoying to me to have to carry a controller to get full game play. 

And that's your opinion. It would be too complicated to carry around an attachment that enables a limited amount of games to be played with a significantly better experience. I think it would be a perfectly fine user experience.

I could imagine a future where even Apple has an official controller that seamlessly integrates into the design of the phone, wrapping on both sides, being slightly modular so that it consumes very little space and enabling tons of games to be played differently. You're definitely right about one thing though, having controller games and non controller games could pose a problem for Apples controlled ecosystem. Obviously you don't want people going to the App store and finding games they can't even play. I think thought would need to be put in there to enable this experience. But like I said earlier, Apple does not care about gaming, they never have, they never will. Right now they care about *services*, do not mistake that with caring about gaming. So no more thought will go into this unless perhaps they see massive success with the gaming subscription service. We'll see where the future leads us.",6

* Apple's ecosystem is more tightly integrated. Especially due to how iOS and macOS enforce much more strict design guidelines. So any of the shortcuts or tips/tricks that you learn in 1 App or in 1 part of the OS.. are likely exactly the same in every other part of the OS or other Apps (because Apple forces them to be). With Windows that's often not the case -- because there's so much fragmentation or old X86 software from decades and decades ago.. that the uniformity just goes straight down the shitter. Apple kills off older API's or support for older software,. so there's a ""Live or Die"" choice you have to make there. With Windows that's not the case. You can keep running Java 5 bullshit Apps decades later if you want. I know that's not necessarily Microsoft's direct fault.. but they could fix it by dropping the hammer on old/lazy developers. 

* another big thing I notice,.. is there's not really any need to babysit or hand-hold the daily maintenance of the machine when you're using Apple. I open my iPhone.. jump to the App I want and use it. It's not complex or difficult to maintain. When I want to do something on my MacBook,. I simply open it and use it. I don't have to do any jiggling or hacking or fiddling or handholding or defragging or anything really. I just open the App I want and focus on the task I sat down to do. 

To me Apple stuff just feels a lot more polished and uniform and easy. Also the UI/OS seems to ""fade into the background"" and never gets in my way. It's never up in my face. 

Whenever I sit down to do something on Windows,. it always feels like a struggle/hassle. There's always Updates pending. There always feels like a need to hand-hold the system in various ways (move files into place, fix error messages/popups, fiddle with settings in 8 different places just to get things lined up before I can even open the Apps I want to use. 

iOS and macOS never feel like that. When I sit down to do something,. it feels like there's a much more direct tangible connection between ""the thought/idea I just had"".. and ""quickly and easily bringing that thought/idea to life"". A lot of the time on Windows,. by the time I've fought/struggled with the OS to get everything ironed out and lined up --- I've straight up forgotten why I even sat down to the computer in the 1st place.

My previous setup was iPhone X, MacBook 12"" Retina, AirPods, 2x HomePods in stereo, Apple TV 4K.

As someone who constantly switches between ecosystems, and has used all major android flagships (s9/10, pixel 2/3, OnePlus 6t, etc), all I can say is that the grass certainly isn't greener on the other side. 

The biggest issue right now is that Google and Microsoft are significantly worse off when it comes to stable software. 

A very big recent example is chrome on Android. The last update broke the app completely. Scrolling is extremely choppy and janky, and the tabs regularly hang for a few seconds when switching. This is supposed to be Google's main app alongside assistant and Gmail. 

Android is a mess right now. Samsung devices are even worse due to the heavy bloat and forced spyware (Facebook) pre installed. Windows 10, the less said about that the better. The task switcher doesn't even run above 30fps, and glitches frequently. Ubuntu is more stable than W10 at this point. 

I jumped ship from Apple around the whole iOS 11 cluster fuck. My new £1k iPhone X lagged more than a £150 Xiaomi device. iOS 12 on my old 6S is leaps and bounds better, so I'll likely be switching back to Apple. 

No company has their shit together right now. The tech world is a mess. Apple might be constantly screwing up when it comes to hardware and quality control, but so is everyone else. The difference here is that Apple has the $$$$$$ to take care of you when something goes wrong. 

Good luck with any warranty claims when it comes to Android/Windows OEMs. No Apple store for a quick swap out. 

The only replacement for the Apple TV is an Nvidia Shield. However, you're still stuck with a limited and broken ass Google play store as your source for everything. There are no AirPods replacements. There isn't a replacement for HomePods (using a KEF Muo wireless speaker, batteries, micro usb, ugh). 

As for laptops, even with apples faulty keyboards there isn't anything out there that is better. I sorely miss the 12"" MacBook. Even the ""latest and greatest"" Chromebook, the Asus c434, had an abysmal trackpad, uneven keyboard lighting, and a laggy touchscreen. 

I can't wait to use things that just work again.

The after sale service may be a big draw for some people but maybe I’m a little jaded due to my recent experience with my iPhone XS Max (I only mention the model to show it’s the newest one).

I told them Bluetooth was having issues on the phone and just putting the phone in my pocket would cause my AirPods to cut out. They hemmed and hawed about needing to update my phone (note: I had not installed any updates recently and nothing changed other than BT randomly being much weaker) so I had to sit there in the store and update the phone to prove that didn’t fix anything before they would replace it. What was most frustrating was twofold, first I talked to support online and was assured I wouldn’t need to update my phone to prove there was a problem (or I would have updated prior to going in) and secondly the “genius” never once asked to see (hear) the problem. He just kept saying “well the diagnostics all passed...”, like I’m not making this up and it reproducible 100% of the time. It was very frustrating to have him say “it looks fine to me” when I could prove it didn’t work in about 5 seconds.

In the end he made up some shit about how static electricity can sometimes cause issues in the hardware that can’t be detected via diagnostics.  I understand that may be a valid explanation but it felt very much like a “we don’t know what caused it but I guess we can’t disprove the issue so here is a new phone”. 

I also had a gen 0 Apple Watch that had the display pop off (I think due to battery swelling) but was told they didn’t cover that, they only covered if the bottom popped off due to battery swelling . They wanted over $200 to ship it away and fix/replace it. This was sometime after series 3 came out...

All that said I once took in a 2-3 year old magic keyboard that the space bar just stopped working on randomly and they handed me a new one for free so I probably am just jaded by recent experiences. I guess bottom line for me is I like their service overall but it doesn’t rank in my top 3 for why I am willing to pay premium prices.",6

I completely disagree with you, but I've never owned a pair so I'm open to changing my mind.

They have a few fancy features, but I can't see myself using them.  I put a podcast in and I'm good for 1-3 hours.  They only have a charge of 5 hours, so at most I'm going to play/pause/next, and my $20 bluetooth headphones do that on a 10 hour battery just fine.

They look douchey.  I understand this is the wrong subreddit and everyone here is going to disagree with me, but nobody sees those and says ""Damn, those are sweeeet"" unless they've also committed $150 to the douchiness themselves.  It's even *WORSE* because for some reason airpod users don't take them out for conversations.  I'm not sure why this is.  It might be because they don't want to hold them since they aren't connected to anything, or maybe because they think they look cool, but you need to take your earbuds out if you're talking to someone in person.  Airpod users, in my experience, do not abide by this universal sign of mutual respect.

I can ""Hey Siri"" without them, not sure what that adds.

Maybe the special mics are good?  I don't really know or care, as I rarely make a call when I'm not in my car or at my desk.  Both places already have integrated headset/speaker/mic setups.  AirPods don't last a full work day, much less a full workday plus after work time, so that doesn't help either.

We're probably not going to agree here, but I'd say the opposite of you, they were the most needless invention since the first iPhone.  iPad (at least initially when iPhone screens were tiny) and Apple Watch made amazing leaps in unfilled niches.

The EU allows citizens of its member nations to cross borders freely, much like how you can freely cross state borders here in the US. In the EU, you could be a French citizen who just decided one day they want to open a restaurant in the U.K., pack your bags, hop on a plane, and move. Without the EU, the person wanting to relocate to the EU would need to apply for a visa and get approved by the government. Much like people who want to move from Mexico to the USA.

Most likely, there will come a day where the U.K. is no longer a member of the EU. Therefore, millions of people who are citizens of other EU countries but living and working in the U.K. will suddenly be considered illegal immigrants.

In order to combat this, before the day arrives when the U.K. leaves the EU, everyone residing in the U.K. will need to apply for and receive a visa. Otherwise they could be deported.

The state department, being entirely aware that they’ll suddenly have millions of visa applications from citizens of EU members. Part of the application process will be people showing up, in person with their foreign passport, and interviewing for their visa.

The state department knows that there’s no way they’ll be able to manually process these millions of applications and grant millions of visa in the amount of time between parliament ironing out the brexit deal and the U.K. leaving the EU.

So their current plan is to release a smartphone app where you can apply for the visa electronically, interview for the visa on your phone, and scan your passport with the phone’s camera and with the NFC reader to read the tag embedded in your passport. Most visa applications will be able to be processed automatically and quickly. Thereby greatly reducing wait times for interviews for the people who do not pass the automatic checks.

Before this announcement from Apple, this app was going to be Android-only, and all iPhone users would be required to go to the state department and interview manually, since Apple’s CoreNFC system does not read passports. Apple is either making an exception for this unique situation and allowing the U.K. access to some private APIs to avoid disaster for thousands of Apple customers, or Apple is re-writing of how CoreNFC works. We won’t know until we see their solution.

This application will NOT be for people simply looking for travel to the U.K., or for people looking to cross the border once Brexit happens. It’s for the millions of expats already living and established in the U.K.",5

Sometimes the appointment even gets canceled if you don’t check in on time...

I think the biggest problem, at least on the Tyson store is the lack of any type of organization at first glance. From being there a few hours over the course of my visits, there’s people for Apple Watch specifically, people in the front to help stir the groups of people into the store, and if they have an issue, they are having to walk all the way back by the cases to wait in line for the person to check them in, but if they want to buy something, they can’t just go up to anybody in the store, because they’ll be directed to the “Express checkout line” which is a tiny roped area next to the cases and that other genius that checks you in. 

It’s manned by 2 people, 1 that gets the items from the back and the other that seems to rush the sale because there’s 4 other customers in that line that just want to get in and get out but can’t because this specific person has to check us out. Services, questions, and any help with the product that she’s scanning have never been a topic of conversation, in fact the name of the person is typed in as X. (speaking from experience). My Student ID was such a hassle that I felt a bother to ask for the discount. 

You may be wondering - ah geez that right side of the store is crowded!

It is, but on the other hand the left side focuses on iPads, Apple TV, HomePod and mainly Today at Apple events, especially kids events on the TV that are roped away.

The center hits with Apple Watch, with the newest iPhone at the very front and a few employees to point in the direction, but none closer to the products to ask for tips, or help.

In my experience, not all the stores are this of a mess. 
Tyson’s is a rare breed, affected by layout within need of an update, along with organization and a boost of employee morale.  

For example, any experience I’ve had at The Fashion Center at Pentagon City has been ten times better. The mess of organization is still present, but due to the crowding of the store, it will probably be known as that in an Apple store for it’s open freedom layout.

The front have employees who greet you, also sort of act as a type of intimation security, and usually direct you in the right way. (Left front is the line to check in, waiting area is the direct center along with those strange wooden chairs.) Buying items is still at a direct express checkout, which sets at a table near this waiting area. The only inconsistency I’ve noticed is that some employees can check me out - but then other times I’m put in this line for an item that I’m holding. (like a power block) but for a return it wasn’t required. (Granted this fable has the receipt printer as well.)

- If you have made the decision to move over to iPhone(and it's not a small change to be completely straight with you), then you will encounter those will belittle and attempt to humiliate you at every turn. Ignore them.

- There will be a number of adjustments and little things that you will need to get used to, and various workflows and functions that you might have been used to doing on Android which will no longer be the case with an iPhone. I am not saying this to dissuade you, but saying this to inform you. You will feel various walls and bumps that you'll hit due to this, because Android is so free-flowing and so open that the relatively closed nature of iOS will feel like an electric shock and dare I say will cause of few areas of frustration.

- But what you get in return, is Apple's retail presence, support from both online/offline should anything go wrong. Contrast this with the Android world where support may be spotty or you're expected to go to vendor forums to hunt down resolutions for your particular issue. I don't know what Samsung retail looks like in terms of support, whether they have exactly the same thing in terms of a Genius bar. iOS introduces just a different way of doing things. Much of the things you could do easily on Android, may take a few more steps on iOS, but on the other hand others do not. It all depends.

- Many things that you might have taken for granted on Android, such as being able to sideload APK files from 3rd party sources. Short of jailbreaking your iPhone, that option is not available to iPhones. But staying within the App Store and the wonderful walled garden is a blessing and curse all in one.

- You will see for yourself the difference in the quality of apps, overall polish everywhere you look and appreciate why users use iPhone over Android. While many of these reasons won't make themselves apparent unless you are fully in the ecosystem(eg. iPhone, iMac and iPad), things like being able to take a phone call from your iPhone on your iPad or iMac, and being able to transition the phone call smoothly from iMac to the iPhone because you've gotta leave your desk is amazing. Granted these days I understand many people don't talk on the phone anymore but for many of us work needs are a priority and users need to be communicated with on a voice call.

I will close this overly long missive with a few final words. I have a friend who is probably one of the most religious Android users you will never meet in your life. Yes he wears an Android Tshirt with the green mascot when he goes out to pledge his allegiance to Android and when I got an iPhone, he said ""this is a sad day for Android"". He didn't stop being friends but he did not hesitate to inundate me with articles on every time Apple's been in the news for something bad, to rub it in.

Because I pay for Office365 yr subscription, I get OneDrive included (I think 1TB!) so I couldn’t possibly need more. All my work documents I sync up there, so I find them no matter where I am.

DropBox for me is a) an additional expense and b) has frustrating features. For example, when sending attachments via Outlook, it defaults to sending a link - in fact sometimes attaching the actual document isn’t even a choice, you just get a link, which I find irritating. OneDrive always gives you the choice.

I use Fantastical across iOS and MacOS. This is a reasonably expensive luxury - eg the MacOS version is $30 or so. But I just prefer the look and interface to the stock app. It’s a good calendar program, and I can’t see myself changing. I don’t think it’s “change-your-life-essential.” But it is really good.

I use Outlook for work email, and stock Mail for personal email. I just like having separation, work obviously uses Outlook, and Outlook on iOS is a good client. But stock Mail is absolutely fine. I’ve experimented with others and always come back to stock Mail.

I’ve used Clear To Do list for ages. Not really sure why, it seemed cool and minimal when it came out, and it is very simple. I’m sure there are better and more functional to do apps, but this is the one that has stuck with me for some reason. To be fair I don’t use it now as much as I used to.

I use OneNote for work notes too - I’m building a fairly extensive collection of important notes for work, it’s an easy place to access information that quickly appears across all my devices. A few niggles amongst the different versions - eg iPad version has “strikethrough” right there and I use it all the time, iPhone version doesn’t have “strikethrough” anywhere that I can see, which is irritating as all hell. But again as I’m paying for Office365 I may as well use this instead of paying for another note service, and it is reasonably powerful.

I stock Notes for personal notes. Random collections of things I want to remember. Our shopping list goes here - I have a note shared with my wife, and the moment we notice we’re out of something in the kitchen, either of us pop it on the checklist for whoever does the next shopping trip. Simple, effective. Shared notes are great. Don’t need a fancy app for this.

I’m old fashioned and still use an RSS app - good old Reeder, which is still the best on the block IMHO on iPhone and iPad. Subscribed to about 12 blogs that publish at various rates and use this every day.

My work sometimes uses Smartsheet and the smartsheet app is handy.

Can’t think of anything else for work. Microsoft RDP occasionally on the Mac.

I don’t really use iCloud Drive for documents. I just find OneDrive superior in every respect.

I do of course use iCloud for backup, photos, music etc, with a 2TB plan I share with my family.",6

These are easy to jump in and out of and take good advantage of the iPhones screen size.

My iPad mini has only a few games installed. Pocket camp is perfect on here. Minecraft is good here too, since it’s easy enough to pair my controller and go. My mini goes with me everywhere and is small enough that popping it out for some quick and easy games is fine.

My iPad Pro is the motherload. I have the 12.9” pro with 1TB. So I keep everything there. I treat it as kinda a console. It has about 80 games installed. All the final fantasy games. Real racing, asphalt 9, runescape, stardew valley, Minecraft, several rhythm games like Cytus 2 and voez, Evoland 2, dandera, grand theft auto, etc. I could list more, lol. But you get the idea. 

Apple TV was going to be an amazing addition, but due to Apple limiting controller support, devs kinda ignored the platform. I have all the jackbox games, since those are perfect for Apple TV. I have some of the compatible games like oceanhorn and evoland, and cross cloud save works great! I was hoping to play Minecraft this way as well, but mojang abandoned the platform. Hopefully Apple can convince them to come back.

There are a lot of great titles that are well suited to iPad. Can’t wait to see Apple arcade expand this collection and bring more games to Apple TV and iPad.

In my opinion, Apple realized the concept of the switch, if by accident, years ago. Sadly the market and lack of proper controller support limited adoption. Instead of one device to rule them all, Apple had a place where as long as you had a device you could play. Join the cloud and you can stop on the phone or iPad and pick up on the Apple TV. You can even connect iPad or iPhone to a tv directly. And to top it off, many devices in apples mobile lineup are more powerful than Nintendo switch. I’m very excited for games like oceanhorn 2 and potentially real racing 4 that can push the limits of the graphics engine.

And all of this cumulates into what we can all hope to see in the fall alongside the Apple arcade release. A gaming ready Apple TV with a12X overclocked, cooled by a fan, and connected to power. This machine would compete with modern Xbox and PlayStation performance. Bundle it with an Apple sponsored and designed controller, and you have a great reason to buy. Maybe even include a free 3 month Apple arcade subscription with a purchase. But this last paragraph is pure speculation and hope.

Apple has always accidentally affected the game industry, maybe this will allow it to actually be a player. I have high hopes.",1

I'm sitting here for the last two or three posts asking you how this is detrimental to the user. Why does it matter if the storage is getting full if it will remove cached items as necessary. I've worded it both ways. 

You just keep coming back saying it's bad. You've yet to tell me ***why*** it's bad. 

&gt;There is no excuse for your phone's hard drive to be sitting at near full almost all the time when you can clear the cache on apps. 

There's also no reason ***not to***. This is ***not a hard drive*** this is flash storage. There is no detriment to the storage being filled, so why bother removing things and wasting write cycles?

&gt;They shouldn't need to un-install an app to do a basic function 

You don't. The system will remove old unused cached items as it needs the space for other things. 

&gt;that's been around for decades.

Yes, because on hard drives filled up drives leads to fragmentation and a degraded user experience. Neither is true on flash memory. 

&gt;I'm well aware of the difference between flash and hard disk memory.

I really don't think you are. 

&gt; Leaving either full constantly is not necessary, and provides a negative user experience

A flash storage device at 1% full responds exactly the same as a flash storage device at 99% full. 

Let me try spelling it out for you. 

* Flash storage does not become fragmented, therefore this is no benefit to removing old files to store new ones together in sectors. 

* Flash memory does have a limited number of rewrite cycles, so there is literally a reason to avoid writing unnecessarily to it.

* Clearing the cache happens whenever is needed by an application or the OS, with old unused files being removed to accommodate. 

* This reduces the number of writes to the same spots, acting similarly to wear leveling, and reduces the number of writes to the index table. 

* An iPhone with a 95% filled storage does not respond more slowly, have worse battery life, or behave differently in any other way to an iPhone with 5% filled storage. 

* Deleting files doesn't do anything about the files anyway, they're still there. The index table simply lists those addresses as available to be written to, so there is no privacy advantage you're missing out on. Even if there was, it's encrypted. 

We have now established that there is no performance impact, no battery impact, no privacy impact, and no positive lifetime impact by letting the OS handle this. 

So tell me why it's detrimental to the user. 

There is no reason to let the user handle it.

Believe it or not -- some people actually like tweaking their device to be the exact way they want it and not how Apple demands you like it.

There's a ton of options with Android that the iPhone simply can't have. Even the simple stuff like being able to customize your control center or, heck, even widgets -- Android dominates.

Plus if you're too invested in the Google ecosystem it's expensive to jump to Apple. I was pretty fortunate that I simply didn't care what Apps I purchased and was willing to slowly start over.

To make it harder to justify Apple -- almost any modern phone is powerful enough to do what most people need. In fact the only advantage Apple has with an iPhone is my ability to share pictures easily. They like being able to see a new picture popup on their iPad or phone but right now iPhones are so expensive it's hard to justify them leaving their cheap Android so they'll get our iPhones when we upgrade.

I mean there *are* reasons to go Android that Apple simply doesn't want to compete with or can't complete with.

But this whole ""you're an idiot if you use..."" needs to go and is toxic as fuck.

If iPhone prices don't go down, though, I wouldn't be surprised if youngsters go Android because their parents can't afford iPhones and, let me tell you, if I offer my kid ""you can get a cheap Android.. or deal with no phone"" want to take a guess that they'll be interested in? Then guess what ecosystem they'll be locked into after a few years.

In any case, these numbers are good for Apple but hopefully it doesn't make them too cocky..",1

I’ve gotten a bit testy at difficult customers a few times but for my best personal, professional, and legal interests, there’s a line I would *never* cross. That includes threatening customers with physical assault and calling customers a “wh***”. If *any* of my managers I’ve worked with ever witnessed that happening, I would’ve been immediately pulled aside and *promptly* fired. No questions.

Apple Genius employees are usually, more often than not, promoted to that position from Sales Specialists and there’s no way that employee would’ve gotten promoted with an attitude like that. If someone boils over to the edge like that, that employee would’ve shown a pattern of behavior that would not align with Apple’s interests. I just cannot see someone risking a job that is known to be notoriously hard to get over a “bad day”—especially towards customers who are, like you claim to say, being polite during the interaction. Nor can I see how this Genius employee got as far as he did in the retail world in general with such an attitude without imploding.

Not to mention, managers will more often than not bend over backwards to appease customer dissatisfaction in any way they can—especially at an Apple Store. It goes doubly so for customers who purchased AppleCare+. It was a simple solution that Apple employees deal with every single day—a device replacement. Hell, I had an iPhone X that had issues the store could not replicate and I just asked for a device replacement since I have AppleCare+, paid the $100 deductible, got a new device, and walked out the store.

I can believe there must’ve been a sour interaction somewhere, but given the facts you gave us—employee threatening physical assault and calling a customer a “wh***” absolutely unprovoked, and the multiple checks and balances put in place to *prevent* interactions like these happening, your story sounds like a statistical impossibility.

That being said, it’s neither here nor there at this point in time, and I wasn’t at the store witnessing the interaction, so maybe the one in a million did happen. But your story just sounds so over the top it’s ludicrous. Hope you get your device fixed.",5

There's a finite number of humans, Apple never tried to target the majority of the world's population, and frankly not a single one of their competitors has a stronger business than them.

Actually, not a single public traded company on the planet is as lucrative as them. This ""shrinking"" narrative when replacement cycles are getting longer and the world's population doesn't grow exponentially day by day is kind of tiresome.

Apple could ""shrink"" for decades and still be around making some occasional fantastic products. That's all that should matter for them.

However... When reading something like this, It all seems so insane. From a business perspective, what do people want more from a faceless corporation? Isn't being the most lucrative one on the planet enough? Why the different standards? Why would Apple do something different than what has brought them to the most coveted position on the planet, as far as corporations go?

I really don't understand. And on top of all of that, stupid Mac keyboards aside, the competition doesn't offer better products than them, just cheaper derivative ones. Just like Apple will do with services. What's the problem with selling second or third rate products? It has worked well for Google. ""Journalists"" have been pushing this narrative since Apple's inception. I guess having a business that is different than selling more potatoes than the competition can be really hard to understand to the illiterate media.

Having said that, Apple has some terrible products on sale today. (every MacBook with the keyboard liability, HDD iMacs, the Mac Pro, older products). I understand that this position won't please the ignorant Apple haters and the ignorant Apple lovers.

(hey, you, I know that you prefer Android and you will buy 1000$ Android flagship devices with lower performing components than the existing XR, as well as worse hardware and software support and a factually worse ecosystem.

Here are my pros and cons:

Cons:
- Notification system: No icon on status bar to know if there are pending notifications, no pending notifications on the lock screen after the iPhone is unlocked, media notifications aren’t as immersive or customizable, there are no secondary or passive notifications, no always on display, etc... The experience is way inferior. The Apple Watch helps a bit, but thats a $300.00  solution.
- No default apps: some apps provide a solution for this but most of them don’t. Example: Gmail can open links in Safari or Chrome, but Safari will open all emails or appointments on the default apps.
- No real file system: Something as simple as downloading a non JPEG or PNG image is basically an impossible task. RAW images for example get downloaded as very compressed JPEG images, vectors can’t be downloaded, etc...
- Photos: Syncing takes a lot of time and its unreliable, deleting an image from a device does not delete it on other devices, face or object detection is not good.
- Shortcuts: Control center is not as good as the shortcuts on Android. If you want to connect to a WiFi network or a specific bluetooth device you have to go to settings.
- Assistant: Siri is just unusable.
- No AI built into the OS: Siri suggestions are a joke, auto brightness is smooth but not good for my preferences, no auto song identification, etc...

Pros
- App quality: in general applications look better and are more stable. Functionality is sometimes limited.
- More stability or consistent FPS: This one is specific to the Pixel I had but performance was getting worse with every monthly update. My Pixel was dropping frames consistently, turning off, shutting down apps and it had a unnaceptable shutter lag after the March update. IOS is stupid stable.
- Better integration with tablets and laptops: Taking calls and answering messages on the iPad or MacBook, using the hotspot on my iPhone without actually interacting with it, registering WiFi networks on all devices at the same time, copying something an pasting on another device, etc... These little benefits improve user experience so much.

Overall I’d say I prefer my iPhone because I own an iPad and a Macbook. If I didn’t own these I would definitely prefer a Pixel 3. The user experience on the Pixel is just way too good, seamless and smart. Performance has taken a huge hit though.

Apparently iOS 13 will be a huge redesign so we have to see what Apple brings to the table.",1

I re-read this whole thread again just now and the original commenter you replied to had described anticipating an end-point where the iPhone itself would have USB-C on board, but in the interim they would like to use USB-C to Lightning cables with their existing iPhone. 

It was pretty evident that the intention here is so that any charge brick they use will work for any of their devices. (I.e have a brick in kitchen, in living room, and in office and any device can be charged from any of them)

You for some reason bring up that having USB-C on the iPhone would be better (and indeed that is what the other person had said initially). For this use case, the USB-A charger you recommend does not fit the purpose. Charging a MacBook Pro from USB-A would be an emergency situation. That it can be done doesn’t mean it makes your solution fit for the purpose.

The fact of the matter is the the only charging brick that can properly charge all Apple devices that charge off of USB is the USB-C line. Even Apple Watch, though it requires the C-&gt;A adaptor.

Your entire premise about USB-A is about plugging it into other places such as a car, but that’s not what the original person brought up. You’re also assuming that someone in this situation wouldn’t just put a USB-A ended cable in the car. I know I certainly don’t carry cables around with me all the time, I keep one in the car. I have a wireless charger on my desk at work. But around the house, I literally only have USB-C charge bricks. It’s super convenient.",2

Sometimes it boots right back up but more often then not it starts a boot loop: the apple logo will show for about 10 seconds then the screen glitches again and boots up again. this can go on for a good 20 minutes.



I think i also need to mention that my iphone storage is almost full (15.7gb out of 16gb). I personally only fill about an 8th of that storage, the rest is under ""system"" which takes up 14gb. I'm saying this because i think it could be related to the glitching but also its annoying as heck.



The first time that happened was about 4 months ago. I got onto apple support and eventually just factory reset my iphone. This more or less stopped the glitching (it happened once or twice but only lasted 2 mins) and pushed the ""system"" size to 5gb for about 2 weeks or so before it started happening again along with my system storage shooting up to 14.7gb all of a sudden one day.

I was on the latest version of ios after the factory reset but now there is another update which i cant get because the lack of storage.

Same would go for all sorts of other adaptors (Ethernet, storage, game controllers, etc.).  Being able to someday buy one device and have it ""just work"" on your Mac, iPad, and iPhone would be amazing.

Likewise, being able to use the same charger for everything -- and being able to use each device to change any other device.  With the right adaptors you can already charge your iPhone from a Mac or a USB-C enabled iPad Pro; being able to extend that to being able to charge your Apple Watch from your iPhone (for example) could be useful to some people.  At the very least, being able to have a single wall charger that works with everything would be nice (I have a USB charger that has one USC-C/PD port on it that I use for my iPad; it could conceivably charge a MacBook/MBP or any other USB-C device as well, for example).

In some ways I like the lightening connector itself better, but from a signalling POV I'm not aware of anything the lightening connector can do that USB-C can't, while USB-C has PD (Power Delivery), can use the same cable for Thunderbolt 3, and can transport DisplayPort (i.e.: you can transport video without an adaptor to a compatible display).

It's a very real thing and I had it. I was worse than this. It's something I think I'm almost completely over though.

Please stop worrying to much about the battery. Just enjoy the iPhone. Charge it when you know you don't have enough power last as long as you need it to last, and stop charging it when you have enough power. It's sort of like keeping your body fed. Just eat when you're hungry until you're no longer hungry, and don't eat when you're not. Or when you're thirsty, drink some water when you're thirsty until you're no longer thirsty, and don't when you're not. Charge the battery when it needs more power, don't charge it when it doesn't. It doesn't do any good to over-complicate it.

I have the iPhone 6s, so I have the luxury of turning off the Battery Percentage indicator completely. So, if you can't do that, then just stop looking at it.

I used to watch my percentage so much and so carefully that I could've convinced someone that I have actual OCD. Ever since turning off that battery percentage indicator, I've been able to change my attitude toward the battery level. Now that all I see is the graphical level indicator and no longer have that exact percentage showing, all I care about is whether it looks like I have enough power. I just quickly glance at it and go from there.

It's kind of like having a reusable clear plastic bottle for water. I don't need to know the percentage of its fill level. All I need to know is how much is in there and I can judge from that pretty easily how long it should last me based on how quickly I usually go through it. I can just quickly look at it and go, ""Yep, I have enough water. Cool."" Or, ""I need to put some more in there."" That's exactly how relaxed I am about my battery level. In comparison to the way I used to be, I feel extremely free. Now I can focus on what matters: using and enjoying my iPhone.

Besides, if I really need to know what the battery level is, then all I have to do is ask Siri - which is something I rarely do since I'm no longer trapped by my obsession and anxiety over my battery level.",1

Apple runs the planet and keeps track of everything so all your grandfather has to do is ask for the thing he wants and, as long as he has either cellular data or a Wi-Fi connection, Apple will show it to him. He has to log in now and then so Apple can verify it's him asking for his stuff. But otherwise iCloud should be pretty seamless to him (at least, until he maxes out his free 5 GB). 

And you know you can get rid of a lot of the apps Apple provides, right? Long press, get the X in a circle, tap the X, delete the app. They can't all be deleted, but I'll bet you can get him down to one screen of apps.",6

But it also feels like autocorrect has gone down hill or just hasn’t gotten any better over the years. There are so many times where it will change a word that I spelled correctly, to some sort of gibberish word I’ve never even seen before. Some of the suggestions are also really weird. As I was typing the word “seen” above I added a “k” at the end to see what it would suggest, one suggestion was “see Jesus”. I have never used those two words together before. 

Thenother thing is that the predictive text is usually slower than my typing so I practically never use it, just like I practically never use Siri. All I ever use Siri for is setting timers, and a good amount of the time that doesn’t even work. Half the time the countdown will show on my lock screen, other times it won’t. Sometimes the alarm doesn’t actually even set so every time I have to go into the clock and check the timer to confirm. Since Siri doesn’t like to work properly when I hold the home button when I’m wearing my airpods, I just stopped using her to even set alarms.

- ""Court of public opinion""?  Every (competent) reviewer is praising the HomePod's quality.  iPod, in comparison, launched to what was possibly the most famous negative review in the history of tech: ""No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame.""

- Price?  iPod was $400, and people lined up around the block to get one.  iPhone was even more.  HomePod was $350, comparable to bookshelf speakers, and is already down to $300.  

- Competition has more features?  Every solid-state music player in 2001 had more features than iPod.  People with Sony Minidisc players would not shut up about it.

Of course, the iPod ended up doing OK.  HomePod is already doing much better than it.  Why would Apple kill a highly successful product line?

If the failure rate was indeed in the 50% range, as the headline indicated, we’d see a huge hit in Apple’s quarterly earnings, as we saw with the iPhone battery replacement program, because these keyboards cost Apple several hundred dollars to repair each. This would enormously cut into the profits of Apple’s Macintosh business. 

Apple sells millions of these machines, so even a 5% keyboard failure rate would result in a huge number of complaints online. Happy customers typically don’t go on social media to talk about their keyboard working properly. 

Beyond that, Apple just put the same keyboard assembly in the newly redesigned MacBook Air, their most popular notebook. If the failure rate was anywhere near as high as indicated by the article, that would mean that Apple is willingly pissing away tens of millions of dollars in future RMAs, when 50% of the MacBook Air keyboards inevitably fail. That makes no logical sense; Apple isn’t run by morons. So that must mean that the failure rate, and associated warranty repair costs to Apple are low enough that it’s not worth them designing a brand new keyboard for the Air

Your phone has minor, cosmetic damage.  This was caused entirely by your actions and choices, albeit accidentally.  Even if you’re on the iPhone upgrade program and get a new one every year it’s just unrealistic to expect your phone to be mint-in-box condition the entire time you have it and take it with you everywhere you go.  If it bothers you to look at it, buy a case that covers it up and then keep that case because it sounds like you’ll need it to protect that area on your next phone too.

So I'm using my Android tablets, the Note 10.1 and 12.2 Pro against the 5S and 7 as comparison. 

Pluses of iOS:

1. Don't have to flash and root in order to make it more secure. Android devices have Google by default, which is a privacy hole, whereas iOS doesn't have half of those issues by not collecting said data. For my average Android device, it takes me close to an hour to get it all set, including installations and customization of settings. Digging in a few settings to lock its privacy down makes it worth it. 

2. It's more straightforward. At least on my Samsung tablets, I always had to play tech support for software updates or other issues unrelated to their faulty hardware. Most Android OEMs no longer support their devices after two years.

3. The hardware is *usually* not faulty. The Note 12 Pro finally died from hardware screw-ups that Samsung neglected to repair, and my iPhones largely bit the dust from accidentally dropping them in water. Otherwise, they're solid. My Note 10.1 is steaming along fine with minor glitches due to age, but relatively better off. 


Cons: Split 1's point among 1-3.

1. If they don't have decent features, you're pretty much dependent on having the correct iOS version in order to jailbreak. iCloud is also relatively insecure given its numerous controversies concerning private information leaks. In addition, NSA members on their board also makes it a bit precarious to use the iCloud. On top of that, users have to be vigilant with apps and their permissions as their Android user counterparts.

2. Tablet UI is heavily backwards. At this point, I don't understand any reluctance to creating a bastard version of Mac OS as the frontend for the iPad line, with ability to switch between the both like Metro/by use, save for the regular 9.7 and below. Like their answer to the Surface Book. iPhone UI feels very stagnant, mostly due to them being too big to use with one hand. 

3. Control Center lacks simplicity. The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functions don't shut off the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, nor do they show networks or devices. Leaving Night Mode with another click feels as convoluted as digging through the setting menu's privacy options. Why's it in a holding click and not something I can activate in the actual Control Center?

4. OTA updates clog up space whereas there is still no straightforward way to clean App Cache and bloated *Documents and Data* storage. On every iOS version I've contended with, there's never been a way to do that necessary function I'm able to do on Android in the Settings pane. 

5. Apple's hardware faults for their iOS devices are based on Jonathan Ive's push towards ludicrously slimmer devices. Which led to phones and tablets bending ,losing industry standard features like the headphone jack, heat issues and so on. Defects that are heavily unacceptable in premium devices over a certain price point, around $700 and up for example are a feature is worse than the ambivalence I got from Samsung. I shouldn't need to put my iPhone in a case just so I can grip it like an actual person or have to baby a tablet because they can't control Ive's lust for thinning everything.",4

fortunately enough, it seems i managed to shake the bug loose for the time being. whether it recurs is another matter. i had already tried rebooting and terminating apps and all, but this is what seemed to finally work for me:

\- terminate all processes via the app switcher  
\- go to settings &gt; general &gt; accessibility &gt; assistivetouch and enable it  
\- press volume up then volume down in close succession, and then hold the power button  
\- when prompted to slide to power off, press assistivetouch and hold ""home""  
\- for good measure, open media apps back up and repeat these steps

then try a reboot. you can toggle assistivetouch back off the same way, or even use siri to enable/disable it.

the listed directions perform a cache reset, which was a lot easier to do when iphones had a home button. apple hasn't engineered an easy way to do this exact task with iphone x and newer: a profound nuisance and a whole other discussion in itself.

i can't guarantee this will work, as i had already done all of these steps in different orders. maybe it just took multiple goes. hope it helps!",4

First, I replied because I didn't see this message until I replied to it.  It's no longstanding grudge; I just didn't get around to it.

Second, it's simply not an issue across Android devices or manufacturers.  If you actually experienced this bug, and it's and Android camera driver issue as you claim, it would be more prevalent.  It's not just the forums I frequent; it's a nonexistent issue across all searches.

Furthermore, you simply have a lack of understanding of Android.  There is no standard camera apk (the application package).  Every manufacturer has their own.  If you have an issue with a Pixel camera apk, it probably won't exist on a Samsung camera apk.

The only reason I mentioned ""shady"" sideloaded apks is that all apps, including those, will show a standard Android toast notification if anything goes wrong.  That is not indicative of an Android problem in and of itself.

And to say it's never happened on an iPhone, when you have zero evidence of either, is just nonsense.  Besides, even if Android suffered from this bug you claim, with zero evidence, iPhones have still had bugs themselves.

There have been foreign language scripts, when sent through texts, have completely disabled iPhones.  There was also a recent bug where FaceTime started the audio before you even responded to the call.

One very important API for almost any modern operating system is the graphics API, which is responsible for rendering content on your display and animating it. 

In the last couple of years we have seen quite a few improvements in this area. We went from OpenGL ES 2 - &gt; OpenGL ES 3 -&gt; OpenGL ES 3.1 -&gt; Metal(iOS)/Vulkan(Android) -&gt; Metal 2(iOS). 

Every improvement in the graphics API improved performance and allowed headroom for more advanced visuals. And this(along with the immense hardware improvements) is what Apple leveraged with their iOS 7/8 and further updates. 

The number of stunning visuals skyrocketed in iOS 7 and iOS 8 and their iPhone 5S and onwards devices supported Metal, a much improved graphics API compared OpenGL. From iOS 8 onwards they started using Metal to render iOS itself(at first it was mostly used for games).

Unfortunately older devices didn’t support this new graphics API. (This is a common theme with a lot of graphics API improvements, even on the Android side, older hardware doesn’t support newer APIs for graphics primarily.)

Now Apple kept building more and more of their operating system around the leeway that Metal had provided, while older devices were relying on their antiquated OpenGL and the sheer power of their hardware to keep up. This is a big reason why the iPhone 4, 4S and 5 saw a sharp decline in their performance and *not* really due to some deliberate action by Apple. 

The iPhone XS is probably the smoothest motherfucking device around. Just scrolling around the user interface and seeing how quickly and naturally your finger is gliding alongside the display and the software, it’s magical. No Android device currently can even dream of coming close to that. Apple has invested very very heavily in their hardware and software stack to achieve this level of fluidity and visual appeal and of course this means that a certain portion of their older devices won’t be able to keep up. (It’s okay though, because iPhones still last far longer than Android smartphones.)",4

However, what this video fails to capture is that when iPhone was released, various phones had nonstandard headphone jacks. Apple popularized a format for iPod (adding a mic) that many Nokias and Samsungs couldn't use becuase they'd set up different pin connections or added some digital or other proprietary extension (like the early Androids did).   


Only years later, when wireless AirPods and water resistance were factors, did Apple ditch the old headphone jack it had established. Without Apple, you'd still have various phone makers making incompatible headphones that only worked with specfic phones.

Apple Watch to MacOS uses specific and custom discovery protocols apple have developed alongside Continuity in order to help devices know where they are via BLE, and then using TOL over a WiFi connection to ensure the watch is a suitable distance away etc. This is all controlled by the software in the macOS and watchOS. You cannot change the software or hardware in a watch to alter this transaction, and also both devices must be protected by iCloud 2FA, something you couldn’t do with a display.

When you think about the display and how secure that is, all you have to do is think. That’s it. If you know what you’re talking about then just think about it. You cannot just throw words like encrypted out and think that solves a problem.

Just look at the GrayKey boxes that are used by law enforcement in the US. An iPhone is “encrypted”. But actually, you can plug a box into these locked down iPhones, and bypass the authentication on the device. And that’s not even a Thunderbolt connection, that’s proprietary connections, proprietary software, and “encryption” on the device.

And yet, you cannot force an iPhone to unlock, by using a WiFi or Bluetooth connection, nor can you do so with a Mac from any device other than an Apple Watch signed into the same iCloud with 2FA as the Mac, and with the unlock feature turned on, on bothe devices.

So im doing video recordings of myself playing the piano with the iPhone Xs. Love the overall image quality. I tap to focus, then drag down to exposure it a little darker to my test, then I hit record which is supposed to keep it at that exposure (am I wrong because it seems so, after I press record it doesn’t go back to bright). Anyway, I sit at the piano, record, come back to watch footage and over the course of a few minutes of record you see that on the right, the white balanced changed and image is hella bright compared to what I wanted in the beginning. Is there anyway to avoid this? Any tips?

Now I know there is “AF/AE Lock” when u press and hold on the screen and then adjust, but it looks different, I can make a comparison of that too. When using the actual Lock feature it looks worse and exposes simply darker across the board while my usual tapping, adjusting, then hitting record looks a lot better even when dark with a lot more contrast. While “AF/AE Lock” looks bad and looks simply like I turned the brightness down on my phone, not actual exposure. Any help?",3

Again. Nobody is forcing you to buy the product. You aren’t entitled to *anything* that Apple does because they’re making a product how they want to make it. Whether you buy it or not is up to you and you alone. That’s the beauty of products like these - you have the ability to make the decisions you want and speak with your wallet. 

&gt;The rest of us are smarter than to happily take that crap and like it.

Insinuating that I’m unintelligent and insinuating that I “like” what Apple does is beside the point (and wrong, at least in regards to the second point.) :)

I don’t like it anymore than you do! Who “enjoys” spending money? Nobody does, but this is a harsh truth of all luxury companies - you take it, or you leave it. The product (dongle) exists. They charge money for it. Your experience using their “main” product (iPhone) will be improved with the dongle. You do not NEED the dongle to use the iPhone, so you do not NEED to buy it. 

Here’s a great analogy: You can buy a Tesla for $35K right now. It doesn’t have any of their cutting-edge features like autopilot, and it doesn’t have as big of a battery, but the product is still fucking awesome. Now, Tesla understands that there’s certain things they need to include with every product if they want their cars to sell. For example, even their cheapest model with the lowest trim package still has insane specs for braking, acceleration, top speed, safety, etc. That said, Tesla doesn’t include autopilot on every model, because you don’t NEED it to enjoy the product. You don’t NEED 500 miles of range because plenty of people find 160 to be adequate. If you want the additional features and specs, that’s fine - you just have to pay for them. 

Businesses like Apple don’t get to where they are by compromising. They don’t throw stuff in to appease customers. They have a vision, they bring it to life, and they let the product speak for itself. That’s it. The rest is up to you. If you want to use your wired headphones, buy the dongle. If the $10 isn’t worth it to you, then you don’t really need it at all, do you? And if you and other consumers realize they don’t need it, then why the hell would Apple include the dongle? It’s a business, not a charity. ",6

A thicker phone?

Send me a link to a video of Android devices doing everything an iPhone can with 3D Touch without it having 3D Touch. One of my buddies is an android user and has said he wished Android had such a feature that was as good on Android. So clearly Androids feature for that is nowhere near as refined. And before anyone says anything, yes, I have used Android devices but never heard of the 3D Touch like feature on Android that doesn’t remove functionality or certain processes. 3D Touch is a whole new layer of touch, Android does not have a touch sensitive screen.

Can you move the Android cursor around text like the iPhone’s 3D Touch keypad? And highlight text with another press on the screen while in cursor mode? I know Android has theirs linked to the space bar and goes row by row, not freestyle like 3D Touch.

In what way is the 3D Touch keypad on the iPhone nowhere near as quick as to manually do it? It’s exactly like using a mouse/trackpad thanks to the pressure sensitive screen. Since, to your definition, a gimmick is something that increases the allotted time to get something done. Everything I mentioned for 3D Touch is something that speeds up a process, or makes life a little easier.

Send me a video of an android phone with the 3D Touch preview effect for website links in a web browser.

Everything I’m asking a video for, it has to be as good or better functionally. If it requires a press & hold, your android device has removed some functionality just to copy 3D Touch.

Things you don’t like because they take longer is very easy to forget that it exists. Which is exactly why for users of 3D Touch when it comes to the keypad find it very difficult to use another device without it.

You have clearly never used it if you are saying Android has that feature. It has a feature that allows you to move a cursor row-by-row, but not freestyle like the iPhone in the way that it’s done. You *have* to use the spacebar, iPhone can do it anywhere on the keypad.",5

It's fast. But so was my iPhone.



Google Assistant is better than Siri, and notifications are somewhat better, although iOS has catched up a lot since version 12.



You can do a lot more customization, if you're into that.



I'm however going back to an iPhone when my 6T has done its job.



All things iCloud, iMessages, Airdrop (most people I know have Apple devices) and most of all the superior quality of the apps on iOS. The exact same apps from the same developers almost consistently perform much better (less buggy) on iOS. Every day I get some notification that some app is draining battery in the background ""would you like to force quit it?"". Some other app crashes every now and then.

Not any of the X-models.

First, I like the size of the phone. I have it in a BookBook cover with some creditcards most of the time. When I listen to radio or (more rarely) music I use the AirPods. Next reminders and calender events are shown on my Apple Watch 3. I only take occational photos. If they have to be extra processed (like the “Portrait mode”) I use Affinity Photo. The 128 GB are sufficient for my 228 apps (no games, but lots of real data (like 3000 notes in Evernote).

Second. I daily watch lots of TV News and some other TV. Here all the programs view are made for the iPhone 6S screen size. So no reason to go for the X-series here.

Third. The whole X-series seems to me to be some sort of “transitional” series. The Face Recognition cannot really be the long term solution. It may be easy for some users, but you also read about situations where it does not work. Worse still is that the physical Home Button holds extra options (the accessability features and app shifting) which I will miss. Because that is what I use all day long with my many apps.

Fourth. I have both a small and the large iPad Pro. So I have two True-Tone screens already. But if the iPhone was my only device I would get an iPhone 8. This gives me the True-Tone screen and Bluetooth 5. So with my usage pattern I would be good for ages.

I read the recommendation to buy the XR for batteri reasons. I am retired so I do not really depend on a very long battery life. Allthough my battery life on the iPhone 6S is more than enough for one day. (Because I also use the iPads during the day. Especially my 10.5 Pro, which is a very handy, portable TV when I am moving about in my house doing stuff) But if I really needed a long battery life (as I did when on the job) I would still go for the iPhone 8 these days. Then I would spend the extra money on one or two Apple Battery packs to be sure I never ran out of battery life.",6

Why? 
My favourite part is how easy all the products work together. They just work. 

My dad, who happens to be a senior, actually convinced my brother and I to try apple after he got his iMac. 

He spent years and a lot of money trying to keep his Windows products up and running for his small business. 
Once he switched to Apple, he saved so much money and time. He got his iMac coming up 8 years ago and hasn't had any issues other than it slowing down. Which a fresh install of OSX helped. 

I wouldn't say that all of the products we have are better than the competition, but Apple has this sort of magic that makes it easy for people to use their products.

I came from windows/android to Apple/Mac about 5 years ago. I used to love how much I could tinker with my machine, setting all of android juuuust right. I love rooting, flashing ROMs, etc. I didn’t mind installing drivers, playing with Rain skins, etc.

Then I decided to be a sheep and go Apple for my undergrad (because everyone else did). Then it clicked. I never installed a single driver, my printer just...worked, everything felt smoother, the trackpad was a dream, and Apple customer service is better than everyone else’s. The machine hardware was great (I have a new MacBook I’ve not had keyboards complaints but it’s a problem regardless of me not having it), it was an aesthetically pleasing device, and it just worked well as long as you were willing to play in the eco system. I also do admit I got an iPhone and iPad and that was another big hook in the ecosystem. I use iTunes, Apple Music, etc.

The biggest seller though? I can just boot camp windows and now I have a windows machine if I want to play a steam game that Mac doesn’t like. I can’t say that is true with a windows machine. 

At the end of the day, use what you feel will work best for you. If you don’t like the UI in Apple then why even bother changing? Most programs in engineering are pretty windows centric (I have been told), so why change to Apple if you’re comfortable in windows?

If you have an iPhone, you can both iMessage AND text message from your Mac, which is super useful in you’re messaging non Apple people from you Mac.",1

Yes this is very common here, too. So you seem to understand their concept: their upfront price is lower than Apple's price, but of course they are not giving it to you out of good will. They get the money via the monthly payments you make. Why do you understand this concept when it is 399$ upfront + monthly payments and not when it is 0$ upfront and then monthly payments? They are not giving you an iPhone for ""free"", like you claim in two of your previous comments.

As you mentioned, there even was a trade-in involved. When you use those type of deals you usually get less credit than selling it on your own, and again, how is this getting an iPhone for free? You paid part of the price by selling your old one...

You basically seem like the exact reason why the companies are doing this. You see 0$ and think you get a phone for free. You don't.

You could back up all texts to a google drive folder or something and install drive on your new phone to access them (sort of) but apparently the easiest method is the Move to iOS android app that is very much hit or miss (didn’t connect from pixel.

I've also said this in other posts, but if all you have is the 6s, it's probably good enough for you, but when you have two phones where one is significantly better than the other, then it's very noticeable and any time you have to step down to the inferior one, it's a big deal. For me I carried my Google Pixel 1 (personal phone) with my iPhone 6s (work phone), and I ended up taking all my photos on my Pixel 1 even though I try to keep work content separate from personal content. The camera made a huge difference. Once I got my 8 Plus, the camera was ""acceptable"" level where anything in well lit conditions I had no problems using the 8 Plus. Go out for a dinner with coworkers at a somewhat dim restaurant? Pixel for sure. With the XS Max now, it's decent performing in dim conditions although I've now upgraded to a Pixel 3 which raises the bar further. The XS Max can at least handle dim conditions decently well that I don't mind using that phone as the only camera I have on me.

Anyhow, my point is this is purely subjective and the phone starts at $999 not $1300. What's worth it for some is not worth it for others. I'm sure there are others who feel their iPhone 4s is perfectly suitable and you wasted money on a 6s.

On older iPhones you can already enable gestures if you jailbreak, but it's just weird - the home button seems redundant but you still need to use it for touch id. Also, reaching the home button is not a problem at all when you hold your iPhone.

Then why did you mention marketing in the discussion about the validity of Samsung's low end sales in a discussion of them vs Apple?

&gt;This information is invaluable to developers who create apps that cater to different market segments. 

Ok sure. But this is a discussion about Apple vs Samsung.  So how is this information valuable at all?

If anything, I'm an Android fan.  (Fwiw, I don't actually care all that much anymore)  I'm simply stating the obvious.  You can't compare Apple and Samsung if you're going to include Samsung's low end sales.  It's an entirely different market segment.  

&gt;I just want to end off with the fact that I never said market segments don’t matter, only the market itself matters and you’re treating it as a completely different category when it isn’t.

The overall market picture is rarely if ever valuble information.  Again in a discussion of Apple vs Samsung, comparing them in areas where they don't compete is useless.   It's like saying Apple is better because they produce TV shows.  Completely pointless.

Because apple is high precision this takes time to take photos and laser scans from multiple angles and then align the panel* just right. This is done for almost every assembly step, they even used to take photos of the front/back white glass of the iPhone 4 to ensure the whites matched. This added a ton of time to assembly over the black iPhone, resulting in vast shortages and a later overall availability date. That’s an example of a recycle time affecting the time of production. For an lcd panel this is pretty straightforward, it’s not placing a physical light emitter on each pixel. We can assume therefore that this step involving the pre-assembly alignment process before placement of each emitter will take higher precision and therefore more time than just laminating a display panel to a backlight. If SHARP is doing this, they may have already developed the most efficient assembly line for this tech which explains the buyout.

Also when building the matrix are we factoring in the reset time for whatever tool is doing this? Let’s say it fills in Y°X°-&gt;Y°Xf, to Y1Xf-&gt;Y1X° and so forth, for the Apple Watch we’re talking about much higher changes in momentum vs inertial stability time: in other words we’re changing the whole direction of the machine proportionally a lot higher on the smaller square display. This costs energy and/or time, whereas an iPhone display has about 6” of placement time vs inertial input time at the display limit. This could mean they can place each individual pixel at a faster average speed. But I don’t know that and I’m just pondering over here.",6

My iPhone 5S can drive HD800 fairly okay, like it definitely sounds better with an amp, but it’s very decent. When I tried HD800 with my iPhone 8 using the fucking dongle the sound was horrific.

How to Block Calls from All Unknown Numbers on Your iPhone

If you're receiving calls from multiple unknown numbers, you may want to take the step of blocking all unknown calls. Currently, Apple offers no one-step solution for blocking calls from all unknown numbers on your iPhone. But you can use Do Not Disturb to your advantage. Simply set Do Not Disturb to a 24-hour schedule and allow calls only from your contacts. Keep in mind that if you receive an important call from someone who isn't in your contacts, you'll miss it. You can, however, check for voicemails even from blocked calls. There's also an option to allow a second call from the same person within three minutes to go through, so you can be reached in an emergency.",3

The side effect is the iPad usage has practically cannibalized usage of the PC. That PC was really used 90% of the time on YouTube and 10% for mail, where both tasks were much more convenient to get done on the iPad.

Adding slightly more key travel to the keys shouldn't really require a *iPhone XR* (194g) of extra weight, even when accounting for the marginally taller bottom laptop chasi (where the CPU, HD, battery and keyboard reside).

There is also a difference between weight and thinness. 

Thinness will (to a point) make the laptop easier to handle and easier to pack into a bag. 

Adding some volume (without increasing weight noticeably) would allow for other gains e.g. a better cooling system for less CPU throttling under heavy load. It could also be used to make the laptop more user upgrade-able and serviceable. This could include things like non-soldered RAM & SSDs, perhaps even a user replaceable battery or other expansion options, depending on the space available.

I recently purchased a Samsung S10E for my wife. She knows nothing about how to setup optimally. I know she just uses it for WhatsApp, Youtube and Facebook. So when customising that phone for her, I just felt it was so much more versatile. Just alot more customisable. Also that screen is BEAUTIFUL and honestly prefer the hole punch to the the notch.

The LG Prada was a feature-phone with a nicer display. The LG Prada was absolutely awful and not even comparable to the iPhone in any way. I can tell you've actually never used one.

I have used many devices, including the iPhone XR. Some say it's bad because of pixel density being low.

It is also a proven fact that most human eyes have a hard time seeing pixels on anything over a 300 ppi if holding the device 10 or more inches away. However, I will be the first to say that Apple could have easily went full HD and put the traditional 401 ppi in the XR like it's predecessors, but I believe that Apples strategy on this is that it would have taken away from the sales of the iPhone X - XSmax and make people question the price tag on those devices, So really we should be complaining more about the iPhone X - XS due to there price point when compared to the XR. The XR's display is a comprise for the other great features that Apple has put into this device, from a larger display, facial recognition, better camera, A12 bionic chip, etc. So the question is will the consumer (you) be willing to purchase this device @ $250.00 less and having most of the same bells and whistles as the X - XS and sacrifice a slightly worse display (LCD) than the OLED displays in the X - XS?

My point is that the MFi program for iPhone in particular didn’t matter.  It was useless for the iPhone as its first and foremost a mobile in your pocket device.  In other words the iPhone isn’t a game console that you sit in a chair and rock out to a game.

The mobile phone’s entire game value (for now) is for when you are out and about and happen to have it with you.  It’d be awfully annoying to me to have to carry a controller to get full game play.  

The subscription model is for when a longer more in depth gameplay is available.  Like when you are on the subway for an hour or waiting for an event to start.  I’d say that unless the iPhone becomes the brain of an in home system like somehow with the Apple TV then controllers unless baked into the iPhone itself do not fit in the mobile ecosystem.

The reason I ask is because I work for cellular carrier and I had a customer insistent that this problem was happening, that their wife's phone was starting a FaceTime call with their son everyday at the same time.  Even if the phone is off, it would turn on and start this call.

I'm like 99% sure that's crazy.",5

The iPhone X design is an evolution of a really good design, they’re not going to scrap its design until they can make something obviously better.

Exactly. Apple ran the financial cost-benefit analysis and wouldn't do it to their own headphones and peripherals, so why would other headphone manufacturers, for example, switch to USB-C for charging? If Apple can't switch to USB-C for their iPhone chargers, knowing that the mass-markets all use USB-A, why would smaller companies that also target mass-markets switch their chargers to USB-C? Every company is smaller than Apple—they are going to continue down USB-A because it would be premature by a factor of 7-10 years!

Good on Apple for getting a head-start, but don't ignore the obvious negatives of not including a USB-A. It's fundamentally bad product design, especially when you consider the problematic-keyboard, unpopular Touch Bar, and to some, poor cooling. It looks cool, but this newer generation is causing more problems than the previous, which makes this a casestudy in design regression.

Perfect size is iPhone X has so if you want newer iPhone to actually bring some new features and be updated - I would save money for even two years just to get X instead of older phones which are discontinued and most likely software updates will drop off soon.

I want you to design a phone **you** will be happy with, not a phone for someone else"". And when they came back with the final result, he said he was not happy with it and they revisited thousands of previous designs and settled with the winner we all know. This story illustrates why Croatia is forgotten, along with many other countries.",4

Apple took a gamble with removing the headphone jack and looks like a lot of phone manufacturers have copied them. So it’s probably leaving most phones for good. 

As for the thinness, I really don’t know. It’s a dick measuring competition for manufacturers to have the thinnest device. I don’t care about that because I always put my phone in a decent case anyways. In fact I don’t know anyone who cares how thin their device is.

This was in 2000, I believe. I used to work for a place called Ritz Camera, which was also a Nextel retailer as well. No camera, no color, no texting, no fun. Buy hey - I was a 20 year old with a cell phone, back when this was seen as more of a status symbol kind of thing.

* **Sanyo SCP-4700** - Not long after, my store also became a Sprint retailer. I changed carriers, due to Sprint having a better network at the time.

* **LG 5350** - My first phone with a color screen! Hooray!

* **Motorola Razr V3i (Product) RED** - Man this was a cool phone for the time. So sleek compared to everything that came before it. I still think this was the absolute pinnacle of pre-smartphone devices. Also, my first camera phone.

* **HTC Touch** - My first Smartphone! This was a Windows Mobile 6.0 (Eventually upgraded to 6.1) device. MASSIVE 2.8"" 320x240 TFT TOUCHSCREEN. 128mb of storage, lol.

* **Samsung Moment** - 2009. First Android phone (also first Android phone carried by Sprint). This was, like most all early Android devices, a slider with a full physical keyboard. Pretty underpowered, but hey - OMG ANDROID. had Android 1.5 originally. Later updated to Android 2.1.

* **Samsung Epic 4G** - This was Sprint's variant of the first Galaxy S device. Each major US carrier back then got their own custom variant, and Sprint's happened to be the only with with a slide-out keyboard. Also, Sprint's first ""4G"" device - this was before LTE had been decided upon as the 4G standard, and Sprint originally chose to use WiMax instead. It did not go well for them, forcing them to eventually switch to LTE. Of course, it did not matter for me either way, as I had neither service where I lived, was still 3G only.

* **HTC EVO 3D** - One of the first ""3D"" attempts in cellphones as far as I am aware (someone please correct me if I am wrong). Had 2 cameras on the back to take slightly offset pictures that could then be combined into a 3D image using the Autostereoscopy capable screen (an early version of what the Nintendo 3DS would go on to use). The pictures were pretty cool, but ended up being a gimmick due to the fact that you had no way to view these pictures anywhere else other than on this phone. Otherwise, this was a pretty powerful phone for its time. This would be my last phone on Sprint.

* **Google Galaxy Nexus** -  Manufactured by Samsung for Google, this was an amazing phone at the time of release. 32gb of storage on a phone in 2011, holy shit. 1280x720 resolution on a 4.65"" Super OLED screen. 1gb RAM. I was now with Verizon, as this was a work-provided device.

* **LG G2** - We are now getting closest to what is considered a modern Android smartphone design. No physical face buttons, minimized bezels, a good camera.

* **LG G3** - Not a massive jump up from the G2, but.. better (and slightly larger) screen, better camera, slightly faster processor.

* **Samsung Galaxy S4** - This marks my (so far, permanent) return to the Galaxy line of phones. The S4 was a pretty big deal at the time, as this was Samsung finally hitting on the iconic look and feel of what came to define their Galaxy S devices. This phone had more gimmicky features than you could imagine, but who cares. It was a great phone. This would be the last phone I'd own that would have a removable battery.

* **Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge** - First phone with curved glass as part of its screen. I remember this being a pretty mind-blowing feature at the time, but I also couldn't help but wonder if it'd end up being just a gimmick. Also, I was now in the world of ""There are no tempered glass screen protectors available for this thing"". My first phone with biometric security (home button doubled as fingerprint scanner) Also, the introduction of Samsung Pay - which has cemented me into the Galaxy S line of devices. Up to 2560x1440 resolution on a 5.1"" screen now.

* **Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge** - This marked the first ""larger variant"" of a phone in a particular lineup for me. My first ""waterproof"" phone (Water resistant, really). Improved fingerprint scanner performance. ""The usual"" in terms of upgrades - bigger screen (5.5""), faster processor, etc. I got my first Gear VR with this phone, was yet again blown away.

* **Samsung Galaxy S8+** - Goodbye physical home button on Galaxy devices. Hello poor placement of fingerprint scanner on the back. Hello iris and facial recognition as forms of biometric security. Cameras on phones are finally now getting to a point where they can be taken seriously (IMO). Up to a 6.2"" screen now. On-screen home button is pressure sensitive. Upgraded Gear VR at this point as well, now with a sorely-needed hand controller. This is the first phone I've ever cracked a screen on.

* **Samsung Galaxy S9+** - Largely the same as the S8+, mostly minor upgrades (faster processor, more RAM, etc). One big improvement over the S8+ though - they moved the fingerprint sensor on the back from being next to the camera to being under the camera. *SO* much better.

* **Samsung Galaxy S10+** - Where we are at today. Much more of a jump up from the S9+ than the S9 was over the S8+. The Bezel has almost entirely disappeared at this point. Resolution is now up to 3040x1440 on a 6.4"" display. Fingerprint sensor is now embedded in the front display, is ultrasonic. I now have 128gb of on-board storage. Front cameras are ""cutout"" of the front screen - a better look than the iPhone notch IMO. 3(!) cameras on the back - wide angle, ""normal"", and telephoto. This phone takes some downright unreal photos. Up to Android 9.0 these days. Biggest battery I've ever had in a phone up to this point, at 4100 mAh. Pressure sensitive home button removed, due to in-display fingerprint sensor. Not a problem however, as now I can double tap my screen to wake it. It'd be nice if Samsung would ship me my Galaxy Buds they approved me for, an said would be arriving ""approximately the week of March 25th, 2019""...

I had the Nexus 6 and used it for hours a day. I really enjoyed watching/browsing/reading on the big screen and stereo speakers. I moved onto the Essential PH-1 and felt it was just too small. I ended up using it more as a true phone than as a mini PC my N6 was.

Once I got my 3 XL, I thought it'd be a glorious return to a mini PC, but this time with good battery life and a far better camera. However, I guess my lifestyle or demands have changed. It's just too big. I occasionally felt that way about my N6, but I always ignored that feeling since my experience was otherwise great. Now, it just feels unwieldy pulling it out of my pocket. It even feels a little too big when I'm just casually browsing at home.

However, I couldn't get the smaller 3. I handled it in-store and immediately saw artifacting and splotchiness. I am used to high resolution displays and would be annoyed by occasionally being disappointed with my screen quality. While I value a significantly smaller phone a bit, I value my user experience much more. If I can ever see artifacting, I'm going to see it all the time. If the Pixel 3 had a 1440p panel like the Galaxy S8 or S9, I'm certain it would have been my first choice.

Other than that, my experience has been good. Yeah, the notch is very poorly implemented and the status bar wastes a ton of space. I had the same complaint about the Essential PH-1, but it's far worse on the 3 XL. If the Pixel/Android team simply allowed 2 rows of notifications, I would bite my tongue. As it stands, if you don't like the notch, it'll take a really long time for you to get over it. 6 month later and I still complain about it to anyone who'll listen, though it bothers me much less.

Compared to iPhones or Galaxy devices, the Pixel is a clear step down in features and quality. Every Galaxy phone has a 3.5mm jack, and the speaker quality is noticeably better on the S9/S10 and recent iPhones compared to the Pixel. Yeah, front facing speakers are **really** nice, but the disparity is so great that I'm questioning which is a more valuable asset: great speakers or front-facing ones. One nice thing about Samsung devices are the Samsung-specific features. You get much better screenshot options and some nice customization (edge lighting, for one). Im also jealous of the microSD slot and notification LED, though they're less important now since my last 5 phones have all lacked at least one of those (Galaxy S1 &gt; N4 &gt; LG G2 &gt; N6 &gt; PH-1 &gt; 3 XL).

Photo quality is better on Pixels, but no one is going to be disappointed with an S9 or iPhone XS if they're satisfied with the Pixel 2/3 camera. I can state that the video recording is noticeably better on the S9, and even better on the XS. The microphone on those other flagships is also noticeably better. I don't have a ton of experience with the XS but comparing the S9 and the 3 XL, I'm embarrassed to talk on the phone or share videos.

Omg, call quality. People constantly complain about my mic quality. Either the first few seconds of each call are totally cut off or I'll just sound distant and muffled the whole call. I'm sure I sound ok occasionally, but it's very unexpected of a flagship that costs $1k. If Fi hadn't given me a $1k gift card, I'd have returned the phone.

I called my gf's S9 to compare mic quality and it was seriously night and day and fully corroborated what every has said. The S9's mic is eerily good. Crystal clear and true to life (not too bassy like on iPhones).

I seriously doubt the Pixel 4 is going to fix these issues. Build quality, component quality, and QoL features aren't the Pixel's strong points. Call Screen is really cool, but I could easily live without it.

That being said, I'll never buy a phone that isn't easily rooted or has a sub-par xda community. I rely on Magisk and Xposed too much to achieve my workflow. Android on my phone is as different from stock as Android is from iOS. I could definitely get by with an iPhone or One UI, but it wouldn't feel as natural and I'd get frustrated not being able to do things the way I want to do them. With a modest mod or three, I can use my phone exactly the I want to use it.",4

I was so excited. Bought myself an itunes gift card to go to town buying some games on the app store. Bought up a bunch of games and was playing them excitedly when my dad called me over and asked why I was buying apps on his credit card. I told him that I'd topped up the account with itunes first and we went to check. All the itunes credit was still on the account, untouched. It took some digging, but on the itunes gift card, in tiny ass print: ""This card isn't eligible for purchasing apps."" Had to pay my dad back for that, and was really annoyed. I didn't really *want* to buy music or movies. I was the kind of dork who just wanted to game all the time. Naturally itunes gift cards nowadays can be used for apps, but back in the day (at least in Canada) they couldn't for some reason. This was the first time I'd ever felt like I'd been lied to by a corporate entity. (Silly me)

As I started using the iPod Touch more, I found myself wishing that it worked like my old $15 MP3 player. The thing barely had enough space on it for 10-12 songs, and yet I was using it more often than my iphone for music simply because of how asinine iTunes was.

Syncing libraries seemed to take forever, and the more I put it off in favor of my $15 mp3 player the longer it took each time. Eventually it got to the point where software updates and backlog of apps, films, and songs was so long that it took two hours to sync. I was pretty well done using it for any sort of media after that.

Eventually I had it cracked because I was a naughty little boy who wanted to play SNES and GBA roms on it, as well as be able to freely transfer songs back and forth like a USB drive.

At some point, I was ready to buy my first smartphone. I was mulling over which iPhone I wanted, but was hesitant because I didn't know if cracking a phone would be harder than cracking an iPod. My friend suggested I just get a Samsung. I kind of scoffed at the idea. How could a knock-off iPhone brand even compare? Apple would definitely have the most games on the itunes store, better features, and just be a more authentic touch-screen smart phone, right? I asked him with a look of disdain if syncing songs and apps was easier on Samsung's iTunes-equivalent than it was on iPhone. He looked at me kind of puzzled and explained that you don't have to do anything like that. I could simply plug it into USB and click and drag files exactly where I wanted them to go. I was fucking floored. A company *actually* trusted me to root around in my phones files and do with it as I pleased? Putting pictures, music, videos, games, and apps in whatever folders I wanted? Like a normal fucking PC? I asked him if Samsung could run emulators. He sorta laughed at me and showed me that there were literally free emulators being offered in the google play store. We did some research, and as it turned out, the Google play store had about ten times the apps that the iTunes play store had (at the time, no idea what the numbers are now) simply because Android was so much more versatile than Apple, and allowed for much more freedom for developers.

Between that and the laughable amount of proprietary cables and 'innovations' like removing the headphone jack, I can safely say I'm *thrilled* to say I'll never buy an Apple product again in my life. They're a far cry from the brilliant little Macintosh computers I grew up playing with.

To this day, I still stick with android, (though have moved on from Samsung to Blackberry for reasons of nostalgic clicky keyboards). I still firmly believe that iPhones are for people who don't understand how to use a computer. That one ""what's a computer?"" ad that Apple put out a few years back made me nearly pass out from laughter because it fit so well with my idea.",2

What the fuck is going on, guys?

Core search is pretty much still OK.  Good on ya, mates.  

Android is doing OK, but the stuff that Google used to do to 'support' it that made them great (eg, the Nexus phones) is all shite.  The best parts of Android come from AOSP.  The handset makers are falling apart - Samsung can't make a compelling flagship, Huawei has been Rosenberg'd by Uncle Sam, and the 'tier 2' flagship makers can't seem to build a distinctive vision for the platform.  

And it only gets worse from there.

Google at its height had the X Prize, which nobody remembers is what actually launched the new age of 'private space.'  

Google Fiber was announced and kicked off the adoption of true high speed internet access (before Google Fiber was announced the fastest products the telecos and cable cos offered were in the 18-30Mbps range - after Fiber, everyone has Gigabit offerings, and are diversifying).

The 'below the fold' products are all in total chaos.  Android itself is fine, but Google's got fully thirty seven thousand messaging apps, all with different, non-overlapping feature sets.  Just when you get familiar with/adjusted to one app, Google announces that this app is being cancelled and drives the userbase to a new platform.

Chrome was once a performant browser that revolutionized the web experience, now Google's draconian insistence on using their own in-house 'standards' (even where they aren't the wider web's open standard) means that the browser isn't actually the most performant.  Google's insistence on 'punishing' Microsoft and Apple for... you know, not being Google means that Chrome doesn't support hardware acceleration or use native OS functions.  Chrome on Windows, eg, replicates whole API's inside browser instead of using the system's much faster dedicated functions.  The reason Chrome is such a resource hog, eg, is because all the functions that could be run in hardware if Google were willing to code to use them instead are 'emulated' and run on the CPU.  

The self-driving project caught our imagination, but has gone nowhere despite huge amounts of attention being awarded it.  

They demo new technologies (like the natural speaking phone assistant) but are never able to deploy them or create a useful application.  There's a bunch of buzz and then...nothing.  

Product after product was swallowed up by Google, languish on the vine, and then die.  

It's like the company where good ideas go to die.  

The one thing that seems to cause all of this is that...no one seems to be in charge over there.  No one is orchestrating a single strategy.  Say what you want about Apple and MS, there appears to be one coherent plan (less so for MS, in many cases, but overall still true).  They aren't constantly demanding the user base shift between apps, they aren't adding functions and then depracating them, they aren't launching products that are attractive and exciting and the terminating them because ... ?  

It's a company in chaos.  It's honestly a shock to me that they manage to make money at all.  The next company that takes a good whack at search is going to bring them down, because there's no coherent plan with Google.  They seem to think, ""We're too smart to fail.""  Except...smarts isn't everything.",4

I have had the Pixel 2 since launch. 

While I like using the XS Max at home, I find it to be to big for my wants. Hardware wise they're amazing. The heft to it really does add a premium feel. While iOS is more limited than Android, it's clearly polished and shows the decade of improvement it's had. 

I have a vehicle that supports both Android Auto and Apple Car Play and am surprised to say that IMO Android Auto wins hands down. At first I truly hated the Car Play interface but after a few days, I'm used to it and it's not bad but the poor use of screen, clock placement, levels of taps required for simple task while driving all add up to make me feel much less safe using Apple Car Play while driving. Android Auto IMO is much more intuitive, easier to navigate while driving and all around more polished feeling to me. In fairness, this was not always the case but Google has done a good job of improving Android Auto over the past year plus. 

Putting my Pixel 2 and the iPhone XS side by side, they are nearly identical in size but the bezel's on the Pixel 2 look so bad in comparison. It really does make the Pixel 2 look very dated now days vs the flagship phones screen we see.

Overall I could see myself staying for the long haul with the iPhone but still feel like I'd be regretting it at times. The lack of a file system that you can navigate is a big pain point on iOS for me. I'm an avid audiobook listener and have a very large collection of M4B/MP3 audiobooks. While I have found some apps for iOS that are serviceable, nothing will ever beat (IMO) the ability to put the files in a folder in the files system and point your audiobook player app of choice (Smart Audiobook Player for me) to the folder and have your whole library there. I store my audiobook library in Dropbox and use an app called Drop Sync on Android to do a selective 2 way sync of a folder on Dropbox to a local folder on my Pixel 2. This works so well and is a setup I've been using for years now. This is likely to be one of my biggest pain points that I will never fully feel happy about if I decided to fully switch to the iPhone. 

One thing that's minor for some but a slight annoyance for me is the lack of interesting and unique phone cases for the Pixel 2. Time has not made this better either. If you look today on Amazon for cases for the Pixel 2, it's 98% black nothing special cases. 

Due to the number of people who use the iPhone (in the US at least) the accessories and case options is so massive. 

One of the reasons I have stuck with the Pixel and Nexus line before it is I cannot stand the way other Android companies nearly abandon their prior years flagships with OS updates. I want the latest OS right away and I want a somewhat guaranteed long duration of updates. 

The Pixel phones are the only Android phones that offer this. iPhone's are the only other phones on the market that also offer this. Apple is pretty good about supporting older models with OS updates for years. Eventually they will drop them from support just like Google will with the Pixel's but by the time this happens, its usually past when I would have upgraded to a newer device anyway. 

I am pretty much convinced at this point however to wait things out a bit longer and see what the Pixel 4 brings. If I could have something on par with the S10 but as a Pixel phone, I'd buy that and be happy. 

If the Pixel 4 ends up being lackluster vs the Galaxy and iPhone XS then that'll likely tip me to go to iPhone.",4

I ultimately decided to switch once I realised that iOS / apple products would be more suited to me. I'm not trying to say that Apple is better for everyone, because it's not, as this thread demonstrates

I won't lie that there are a couple of things about Android that I miss, and I'll probably end up buying an Android phone as my secondary phone eventually 

Here are just a few of the reasons I like my iPhone:

There are a lot of very good apps that are only available on iOS (Drafts, Bear, Things, Overcast, Omnifocus, Mindnode, Fantastical, and Notability; just to name a few)

Siri shortcuts is much more powerful than the automation features on Android 

Callback URLs - They're extremely powerful if you know how to use them (which isn't hard to figure out, as long as you're confident at googling things)

Because the cellular Apple Watches are incredible, and are way ahead of Android smart watches 

Because iPad Pros are incredible - Far better than any Android product, or the Microsoft Surface (at least for my needs)

Better privacy - Google doesn't have as much of my information 

Also related to privacy - google ultimately makes its money from selling ads. Apple doesn't. So Apple has more interest, from a financial perspective, in protecting your information 

Being able to go to a Genius Bar to troubleshoot things. I'm tech savvy and I can solve most issues by googling, but sometimes it's just handy 

Incredible customer service by Apple staff

iMessage 

AirPods 

Siri - it's actually a lot better than people give it credit for 

Better resale value of devices 

Easier to find good quality second hand devices

A lot of the additional customisability options in Android are things that I don't personally carefully about 

Find my friends 

More frequent software updates 

iOS 12 runs well on the iPhone 5s (released September 2013). Good luck finding an Android from 2013 that will run Android P

Apple Maps - I prefer google maps overall, but I like being able to access both of them, and find myself using Apple Maps more than 50% of the time 

You can easily access Google services from an iPhone anyway 

I have more reasons than that, but you get the idea",1

I would agree with what many others have said.  Being an adult means not being able to spend 24 hour sessions playing video games every weekend.  Then, because of that you end up not spending even 8 hours at a time.  And soon you just find your time is more valuable doing a weekly chore you have to get done (e.g. laundry, groceries, bills...etc.).  Or you have kids now and suddenly your time is spent enjoying them or you have a significant other (or both) and now when you have a day off or free time after work you're spending your time with them.  As a kid/teenager/young adult it's very easy to spend every waking moment with video games, a hobby, friends...etc.  But, as an adult with many responsibilities it's not that easy anymore.  I ended up finding that if I became too involved with several games and I would forget my responsibilities and when it came down to the truth of the matter the games I was getting ""too involved"" in were not very rewarding anymore (WoW, Diablo, Destiny, Division, Final Fantasy...etc.)

#GamesTodaySuck
This is really true in the market right now.  There are very few games that are truly rewarding in that you can sit, play, invest 30-40 hours and then be done with the game and be satisfied.  Every developer/publisher/designer has been corrupted by the corporate Juggernaut known as micro-transactions and monetization.  This means that when a game is released they don't consider it a final product anymore.  They have to show on a balance sheet or projection chart how that game will earn them dividends over the course of the next 1-2 development cycles or it's not worth making at all.  Nintendo is about the only company out there that has games which aren't solely focused on ""buy this or buy that to help you look cooler or make your character better"".  I'm not saying they don't have those games, but many games aren't made for that purpose.  Look at the mobile gaming market.  There are either zero or close to zero games that are designed for the sole purpose to play, enjoy and move on.  I would be willing to pay $5, $10, $15, even $20 if the game could be enjoyed for 20-30 hours of total play and then done.  Nope.  Every game is designed very lazily and then has ways to pay small amounts (e.g. $1-$10) to increase your power, character look, progression...etc.  And there is no way to avoid those transactions.  Scroll through the entire Game market on an Android or iPhone.  Any game that isn't loaded with micro transactions has maybe 10 hours of play before it becomes exceedingly repetitive and unrewarding.  This is true for the Console/PCGaming market now.  There are very very few games on the market now that have premium content, gameplay and replay ability that aren't loaded up with monetization built into them or subscription based annual fees.  This is just ruining the whole enjoyment to a game.   

I could keep ranting about this for hours.  The current market for games is about monetization after a game has been developed and brought to market.  The purpose of a game (at least for me) was to play, enjoy, have fun and then find another game.  Games now are solely focused on how they can keep you playing their one game till the end of time and keep making money off it after your initial purchase.  Please don't list the different options available that counter this.  I know them pretty well.  But, the 99% of the market sucks and #GamesTodaySuck.",5

Once you get an iPhone, before you know it, you are stuck with them forever because they're so damn expensive that it's unreasonable to buy outright. Suddenly, you're in one of those upgrade programs where you essentially don't own the phone and have to upgrade every year and pay every month on a phone you don't technically own. I'm not saying other companies do not have this option, because they do, and I guess that kind of nullifies this point, but still. The prices are obnoxious. The smartphone market has, in general, been getting more expensive. Like, flagship Samsung phones and Huawei phones are $1k+ too, but at least they offer new features and innovation, while Apple just shits out the same phone and changes very little and people flock to it.   


Furthermore, I hate notches. I know most phones have notches now, but not all Android phones do. Apple, while not the first to have a notch, popularized it. And I hate them for that.  


Apple isn't innovative (anymore). They used to be, several years back. But now, it's simply speed upgrades with new chips and camera upgrades. Most at least mid-range phones have at least decent cameras and it is at this point mostly subjective on which phone has the 'best' camera. The difference is negligible either way and I don't take pictures outside of reminders and school stuff. It is a similar story with speed. iPhones are fast, there is no denying that. However, Apple very quickly slows down their phones after a new release that the whole speed argument kind of falls apart.  


Apple is greedy. They lock the user into its ecosystem and force them to be stuck with them for years. I often hear that the reason Apple users won't switch to Android is because, simply, they are ""stuck."" I don't want to get stuck. Apple offers so many things that after someone owns an iPhone, they find themselves subscribing to all these different services and buying all these different add-ons and extras, which, naturally are more intuitive and useful on iPhones and, I believe, in some cases not even offered on non-Apple hardware. For example, Airpods, Apple Music, Apple TV, and all other Apple services that an Apple user might have, too, essentially makes switching to Android a hassle for Apple users.  


I also really dislike the software and lack of customization. That's mainly a personal preference thing and I'm sure if I were stuck with an iPhone for like a week, I'd get used to the layout and stuff, but the customization gets me. I would likely get bored of the same old layout that's essentially existed throughout most of the past Apple's major updates. And I guess that's partially why Apple is so popular. Their brand and their layout of everything software and hardware hardly changes to a point where anyone can recognize an iPhone (often even with a case). On the other hand, with a case, it is much harder to recognize a specific brand of an Android phone.  


The only thing I can credit Apple with is their ability to keep older devices updated, software-wise. Sure, maybe it doesn't help that they slow down their not-newest-gen phones, but I wish Samsung and other Android phone manufacturers would keep older generation phones updated quicker.",4

My point is that the same way you trust some people (family or friends) with your house keys, you can trust that the most obviously popular and common apps on the Play Store are ***not*** malware. Again, I'm strictly referring to malware/scam NOT privacy.

&gt;But what about when you're casually scrolling through reddit on your phone. Oops, just installed a web worker that's now permanently observing me.

Please describe how clicking on a link on reddit will automatically install an app on an Android device with no input from the user? (Considering I'm a typical user that hasn't rooted my device and did not enable installing from outside sources in the Security Settings).

&gt;Do you also avoid any url link shorteners, or are you confident enough in your skills to predict the url that you will be redirected to?

On PC I rely on my anti-malware app and on Android I rely on the fact that you cannot install an app from an a source outside of the Play Store with no extra user interaction from me.

That URL shortened link might take me on the most spammy/malicious site on the Internet, which will block my Chrome browser with fake popups and try to fool me to install some crappy fake anti-virus what ever, I can simply close the tab and that's it. This assumes that you are at least savvy enough not to think that you are actually installing a true app.

In case I'm not able to close the tab I just kill the Chrome process. Or in the most absurd case, I reboot my phone completely. Either way, apps CANNOT install on your phone if you don't enable install from outside sources in the Security Tab or you are rooted (though even then it's not exactly easy).

**LG Xion (GR500)** (2008 - 2012) My first phone (slider). It lasted till the battery was shot to the point where it would not even last 5 minutes without dying. Also during its stressful lifetime it somehow survived a cycle through the hotel washer once while on vacation. After getting it back at the concierge, we were all surprised it turned on without any water damage (if it did not work, I'd be without a phone till I grew more responsible)! Anyways somehow its metallic screen protector and my external case (not waterproof) stopped the water from getting into the speaker and thus saved it!

**iPhone 4S** (2012-2015) After I needed a new phone, I had my expectations set pretty low on my next one, another basic phone. After we arrived at the AT&T store, my dad let me pick a smartphone between Android or iOS. I chose iOS and ended up with a 16gb 4S that was overstock from the previous year. I kept it on iOS 6 its entire life cause I hated the radical iOS 7 UI (contributing factor why I migrated to Android due to its customization)

**LG V10 (H900)** [2 units](2015 - 2019) My 4S was dying and I was planning on getting a new phone. I searched around and the V10 fit my bill. Durable, great camera, removable battery and 2nd screen all seemed to interest me. I originally wanted a unlocked model but, I was granted the AT&T one for my 18th birthday (can't complain about a free gift!) The downsides of this phone were the atrocious battery life, its screen-burn and tendency to boot-loop. Thankfully my first one lasted till August 2018, when it died on vacation due to being used for 5+ hours as a GPS during our long car ride. I tried to revive it with some of the tricks but it ultimately failed. Amusingly LG was very helpful with my boot-loop situation and offered to repair it for free because I was informed of the issue and the extensive repair process but charge me for the fractured camera housing that was not related at all to the repair. So, when I got back, we sent it to Square-trade where they declared it totaled and shipped back another one. After I received my second one, I thought it would be a great idea to plan for the future cause the bootloop defect will just happen again down the road. So far, my V10 was my favorite phone I ever owned.

**Galaxy S10** (AT&T) (Prism Blue) My V10 was getting old and since it could conk out at any moment again due to the boot-loop defect, I felt it was a good idea to plan ahead for another phone. I planned for a European LG V40 however, last month, my dad informed me his older Galaxy was dying and, we could upgrade together with one of the promos going on. Due to my finances, I decided I'd stick to something more affordable till I finished college. I narrowed down my choices to both the AT&T variants of the LG V40  and the Galaxy S10, deciding  to give Samsung a shot with the Galaxy S10. Both my father and I bought S10's 2 weeks ago and, here I am today. So far, I love how it has a more efficient processor, better cameras, a beautiful display, and best of all, I no longer have to deal with screen-burn compared to my V10!

Since iPhone 3. Wanted to make the switch to android for years as the incremental updates, along side the crazy $ Apple asks for, especially in hardware is now just insulting. I just couldn't find anything that would match the quality of apple's hardware nor the ease of use of iOS. 

Almost made the jump to Huawei Mate 30 but then came the new S10 line up. The screen is mind blowing, the cameras are a lot more versatile, having a headphone Jack again make me so happy. I can't stress how impressive the engineering is behind the entire device is. I still wish we had a proper dedicated night sight or equivalent but I  have zero regrets.

There are a few notes specific to my use case, but also for average smartphone users:

1. I definitely consider myself a power user and more tech savvy than average. This means all the amazing customization and tweaking is a limitless playground and something friends on Android have been preaching for years. I've had the S10 for almost 6 weeks now and I'm still customizing something on a daily basis. I'd say for most people who just want things to work with minimal digging of settings (99% of my family members) are probably better off staying in the iOS ecosystem, that is if they can afford to.

2. Security is still a lot tighter on iOS out of the box. That being said, if you know how to adjust and limit permissions of apps and know what to look for when certain apps  ask for crazy permissions then I think Android can actually be more secure. 

3. I can now literally do about 80% of my work on my phone now. For quick business trips, I'm confident that traveling with just my phone is sufficient, especially with DeX, which I have yet to try out.

4. There are still a few things that I do miss from iOS: the UI I think is still more polished and responsive. Not that the S10 is a slouch by any means but it's super small things like force touch, quicker unlocking, a slightly better keyboard IMHO, that when added up, incrementally provides a smoother day to day user experience. 

5. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is something that I'm still not used to and is the one thing that feels a step backwards. This has to do with speed and accuracy but also ergonomically, because there's no tactile indicator of where your finger is supposed to go, it feels like a guess every single time.

At this point I can't see myself ever going back, especially now that I've broken free of the Apple ecosystem. No more mac computer, apple TV or any other apple device. This is probably the hardest part for most people but a lot easier than you think as there are equivalents for everything except maybe imessage, which I don't really care about but if you suffer from FOMO then it'll be tough.


TLDR;
Long time iPhone user, made the switch on launch day of the S10 and will not be going back.",4

All these ""recommendations"" to disable battery optimisations for the failing apps are wrong.  Why? Let me explain something that I thought we pretty much all knew, but reading through these comments I can see no other mention of it, so maybe it's a bit more obscure than I realised.
  
Push Notifications work on Android because of Google Play Services.  Yes, that app that doesn't show up in the Play Store unless you search for it in Google and click on it (much like the Camera App)
  
It is the SOLE APP that is allowed to keep a network connection open all the time*.  It is Google Play Services (from now on, GPS) that ""gets"" the push notifications for the other apps and it then WAKES THEM UP to say ""Hey, you got a notification"" and the app then wakes up and displays the notification/does its thing.
  
You can pretty quickly see why each app doesn't keep it's own long-life connection back to their home - if every app did this the phone would never sleep.  That's why (almost all) apps use GPS for push notifications.
  
If you're not getting push notifications on time, something is WRONG with your GPS connection.  OR maybe there's a problem with GPS, which would explain why some people report March being the problem, some April.  Google pushes out GPS updates in the background, silently, in slow, staged rollouts.  Some of you will be on different versions than others.

Now before the experts jump in, yes, some apps do hold their own connections open.  Things like the Conversations Jabber app, it can use GPS but mostly it relies on not being forced to sleep to get the connection open to your jabber server.  Any Email app that supports IMAP PUSH as well, it has to keep a connection open to the IMAP server, not using GPS.
  
But Gmail, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and millions of other apps all use GPS for push notifications.  They register with Google on the server side and ""push"" messages to GPS, which wakes up the app you're using.

To put things in a perspective, I have seen a guy, few months ago, who owns a Note 8 and he  does not know how to operate it well.. Perhaps taking shots from now and then, but It was clear that there are many futures  he was not aware of. He does have the peace of mind you are talking about: the latest of its kind then, a great camera and a valuable item. None of this is important for me personally and some this criteria are a minus for me, like carrying a valuable item that i am constantly afraid of dropping. 



There is a story to my S4 mini. Before I had Note 3 that I had been using for 4 years. It has been lost some times ago, and i was trying to buy a used Note 3 because i was used to it. Then I could not find one and decided to wait, meanwhile I bought used S4 mini that had a slightly broken screen. When I got my Note 3 I could not switch back to it, instead I kept using the S4 mini, even thought I still had at the time Kitkat 4.4 and few Apps are not supported there anymore. Then I rooted the S4 mini and installed Android Pie 9.0, all applications I use are there and everything is snappy like never before. It is now encrypted and all my Emails and few banks application are working flawlessly.. It is small and easy to carry, also I am not in need of worrying of someone steeling it. I could not feel any peace of mind like now. A new one would of course look better, but it does not necessary serve the superpose of a phone for me. The Internet I am using is a cheap 3G, that won't make use of LTE, and it is week so that an expensive smart phone would be an overkill. 



If you like to buy something nice that makes you feel better then it another story.. some people woul consider owning the last phone almost as cult, nothing wrong with that, it is just that I have other priorities while making use of older phone at the fullest . I am not denying myself comfort, I am comforting myself with something else.. but I am still doing most of daily activities using my phone.. I have to find a thing that my small phone wont do as well, and could not find anything but the camera. But I do not take pictures even once, and I had better camera before with almost no use. My Note 3 is sitting at home.



You feel better buying a better phone, you enjoy using it, you rather have that, then go for it. I enjoy keeping using my old phone, until I see some limitations in it or something that it cannot do for me: like when it had Kitkat 4.4. I watch new phones popping up from now and then, but I don't get involved in buying them, and I have never regretted that.",1

Absolutely they are. Huawei is likely giving mobile carriers a reason (I'm talking $$$) to sell the phones so cheap. You can get a P30 Pro for $149 or P30 for $0 with Bell right now. Of course I would not encourage doing any business with Bell what so ever, the fact is Huawei makes their devices an easy choice when other devices like the Galaxy S10 which goes for $320, Pixel 3XL for $230, Note 9 for $350, and even the Iphone's go from $129 for an Xr and $459 for an Xs, all on the same terms you'd get with a Huawei device. 

Huawei is getting attention for its 5G networks it is trying to promote and sell, which Canada has already banned. The same networks they would use to spy on other countries and companies who use their tech. 

Also, they essentially notoriously stole Nortel technology. 

Although most of the news has been generated in the U.S, other countries and large corporations are hesitating or simply not going to use Huawei technology and networks. 

There are some noteworthy points that happened in 2018, which personally, would leave me not wanting to touch any of their phones with a 10 foot pole;

- Feb. 13, 2018: FBI Director Chris Wray warns against buying Huawei and ZTE phones. 
- July 11, 2018: Australia says it'll ban Huawei from 5G rollout amid security concerns. 
- Sept. 7, 2018: Huawei gets caught cheating on a phone benchmark test. 
- Dec. 5, 2018:  Britain's BT says it'll strip Huawei equipment from 4G network by 2021 and won't use it in 5G core. 
- Dec. 7, 2018: Reuters reports that Japan will stop buying Huawei, ZTE equipment. 
- Jan. 11, 2019: In Poland, a Huawei employee gets arrested over alleged spying. 
- Jan. 18, 2019: China says a Canadian ban on Huawei's 5G tech will trigger ""repercussions.""
- Feb. 4, 2019: Report says FBI raided Huawei lab and set up a CES sting. Also, two of the company's staff were expelled from Denmark after work permit inspection.
- Feb. 6, 2019: US State Department discourages European countries from using Huawei equipment in their 5G rollouts
- Feb. 22, 2019: Italian politicians reportedly push for Huawei 5G ban.
- March 14, 2019: **Huawei is developing its own OS in case it can't use Android or Windows, report says.** This one. Is. A Huge deal. 
- March 28, 2019: British watchdog warns that Huawei products represent ""significantly increased risk.""

Edit: not trying to discredit their abilities to put together a solid phone, but the attention they are garnering over the past year and a half or so and their possible association with Chinese Gov, forcibly or not, is concerning. ",4

Now, it's important to mention that due to my still undiagnosed mental condition, I was always thinking more rationally than emotionally, because I basically didn't have them. Think of my 16 yo me as of an android who still learns what emotions are and how to imitate them. Now, we had to read the book at home. My teacher was cool, because she didn't force anything on us. She just gave us a book, told us to read it (or, if there was a film adaptation, skip it and watch the film) and think about it ourselves. Then we had one whole hour to talk about it in class. 

So, one girl raises hand and, when given permission, starts talking. Her every word paints a picture - there is this great anger that creates rift between the families, and even greater love that tries to built a bridge above it. There is death and pointless fighting, and it ends with a tragedy which echo will resonate within the people who truly understands Romeo & Juliet for generations. People listen to the girl and nod, half because they agree, the other because they don't understand even a bit of what she's talking about. Our teacher looks at her, nods aswell, and asks if someone has something to add. I raise my hand, my teacher groans quietly, and gives me voice.

""Well, for one, this wasn't great love. Romeo was horny and Juliet was 14."" 

Then I said that everything there was pointless, they were idiots, and that's the whole joke. It's funny because we're better than them, and if it isn't funny, that means we're as dumb as the characters and that's why we don't see it. My teacher wasn't even surprised, tho.

Stable and economically viable nuclear fusion energy. If this is successfully achieved, it's big power for relatively little money and it's also safe, because there's no risk of meltdowns whatsoever unlike with conventional current-day fission reactors. Fusion also produces no high-activity long-lived waste like current fission reactors do. The radioactivity of the components in a fusion reactor is low enough for them to be reused/recycled within 100 years. It also doesn't contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
2. A fully circular world economy, where nearly 100% of everything we dispose of will be recycled/reused without creating any non-recyclable waste, because right now we're depleting Earth's resources at an alarming rate. If we don't want to live on a dead, barren depleted rock with a crippling resource crisis by 2100, we're going to have to implement a circular world economy somehow. I believe that in the long term it can be just as profitable as our current-day linear economy, which has a take-make-dispose model of production.

5. Major scientific breakthroughs in healthcare all around the world, leading to cures for severe diseases like cancer, HIV, etc. as well as not needing transplants anymore because of grown organs/synthetic organs which will hopefully be possible.

Or just have your consciousness stuffed inside an android body, but that might be way further in the future, I'm not entirely sure about that topic.

Quanta Computer is the company that makes Amazon's FireOS devices and they're also a Google ODM. Google has not blocked them from making non-Google Android devices.

Amazon FireOS ***IS LITERALLY A NON-GOOGLE ANDROID FORK***. Amazon is LITERALLY using Android on its devices. FireOS = Android by Amazon.

I'm sorry, are we talking about Android devices or Android phones? Android OS runs on many different devices.

No. It's very relevant. It proves that Google isn't blocking their ODM partners from creating and offering alternatives to G-suite.

Summary:

1. Amazon's FireOS devices prove that Google isn't blocking Google-less Android products.

2. Quanta Computer proves that Google isn't blocking their Android ODM hardware OEM partners from making Google-less Android products.

3. Samsung duplicate apps and services prove that Google isn't blocking their Google Android devices from shipping with competing apps and services.

4. Samsung Tizen smartwatches prove that Google isn't forcing their Android ODM partners to only use a Google OS or platform on devices.

5. Samsung Tizen phones did make it to market which is proof that Google isn't forcing their Android ODM partners to only develop and sell Google Android phones. Samsung chose to stop making/selling Tizen phones for the time being, mainly because Tizen was a security nightmare at the time and hadn't gained much phone-level dev support.

6. The existence of the combo phone service plans offered by carriers without the ability to split the combo proves that companies can sell their services in locked combo packs within the EU.

There are always bumps along the way and things turn out a little differently than what you originally expect. But I'm enjoying the experience nonetheless. Mostly, the only thing that really bothers me is the walled garden aspect, which is wonderful as long as you have alternatives. But when you're cut off from the choice, I hate it. Like the app store. It's nice and all but you don't get a choice. If Apple doesn't approve an app, you can't use it. No way to install anything any other way.

I've moved further away from Google ever since. I was fully invested in their ecosystem back on Android.

I've switched from Chrome to Firefox recently and constantly think about which Google services I want to keep and which I might be better off replacing.

I haven't looked back so far.

Especially EMUI 5 and 8 on the Mate 9. It was fast, reliable, regularly updated, had useful features, could be thoroughly themed (importing icon packs system wide for example) and largely got out of the way. 

Generally I find Huawei's software less intrusive and full of dark patterns than Samsung's. Samsung is all about trying to push and ideally lock users in to specific features and orders of operation that may not be of any value to the user whatsoever - like Bixby and endless other dubious integrations that take a lot of taming and turning off. The latest being some kind of dire local business tab in the dialer, yikes.

Huawei has done a few Samsung-style things post the P20s, chiefly in that there are now a pile of settings that should be on by default and aren't, or should be off by default and aren't - just like Samsung's phones. When I talk to friends and colleagues with Huawei or Samsung phones I often end up showing them all these settings that massively improve the experience if they're toggled. Like hey, the awesome dark mode which is under 'Battery' settings for some arcane reason. Maybe you like exploring your phone's software, maybe you prefer it to just work to the best of its abilities out of the box, but this is how it is with both of these brands.

Huawei is the most vertically integrated Android vendor thanks to Samsung's continuing strategy of dual sourcing SoCs. Huawei's hardware is great. Their software interestingly seems to get consistently bad reviews from the US tech press and good reviews from Asia and Europe, which I feel speaks to the differing needs and preferences between those markets. 

EMUI 9 is a bit messy and inconsistent and buggy on the Mate 20 Pro. I get the impression it was rushed. This combined with how locked down the devices are now, how many hoops you have to jump through to update it manually if you can at all, and the weird combo of region-specific software + updates being deployed based on the SIM present in the device + mismatched CTS profiles if you put a different SIM in while travelling and receive an update that doesn't match the preloaded build is frankly a bit off-putting. 

Thankfully EMUI 9.1 on the P30s goes a fair way towards fixing some of the regressions in 9.0. The inconsistent icons are gone and there are third party notifications on the always-on display - that's a start. Looking forward to more.

But when I get to my gate and try scanning... it doesn't work. It just keeps not working; the screen is going blank. So after several tries, while I'm holding up the boarding line, I give in and pull my phone out of my pocket. I have ambient mode turned off on my watch, and apparently Google never thought it'd be reasonable to add a ""force screen to stay on"" feature to the Wear OS developer API. So yeah, I have to go in and fuck with my display settings to get the QR code to show when I flip my wrist over to scan it at the gate, unless I get super lucky like I did at security that day and the scanner picks it up before the display sleeps.

At about a year and a half old, the battery is already starting to get to the point where I'm coming home from work with 40% battery left or less. Once it's past usability, there's almost no way I'm getting another Wear OS device. Maybe a Fitbit or, hell, a normal analog watch, now that I'm used to having a timekeeping device on my wrist. I'll miss the notifications and ability to text my friends a poop emoji without pulling out my phone, but it won't be the end of the world to lose either of those.

I guess you might get the impression it is not a new operating system as it will still be able to run android applications. But that isn't what does or doesn't make a new operating system. What does is the kernel, the core of the operating system if you will.

On top of that you can still build a bunch of compatibility layers so can run applications from other operating system. There are for example implementations of the android runtime (ART) for other operating systems allowing android apps to run on other things than android. 
Just like you can actually run java applications and .net applications on many operating systems as they all use a similar approach to how applications work (but that is a whole different story). 

Google might decide to rebrand fuchsia as android at some point as people know android but that will still make it a new operating system in it's own regard even if some top layers remain compatible with android.

First, perform a full reset of your device. Start by navigating to the Bluetooth device list on your smartphone. From there enter the **Settings** screen for your Jabra Elite 65t, and select**Unpair**/**Forget this Device** (or something similar). After you have performed this step, turn off Bluetooth on your smartphone.

Next, perform a reset of your Jabra Elite 65t. Complete the steps as shown in the picture below:  


Resetting the earbuds will reset all settings and clear the list of previously paired devices.  


Press and hold (10 seconds) the **Multi-function** button on the right earbud until the LED flashes purple

After resetting, turn on Bluetooth on your smartphone, and then re-pair with your Jabra Elite 65t. Now test and see if the challenge persists.  


If you still experience the problem, try to reinstall the firmware. This is easy to do from Jabra Sound+. Make sure you have the Jabra Sound+ app installed on your smartphone, as well as the Jabra Service app if you have an Android device. You can install both apps from your app store. When the apps have been installed, open Jabra Sound+ and make sure your Jabra Elite 65t earbuds are detected (they should be colored yellow in the upper left of the app) as displayed in the screenshot below. This may take a few minutes to appear if it is your first time using Jabra Sound+. Note that the Jabra Elite Active 65t is used in the screenshots below, but the instructions are the same for both the Jabra Elite 65t and Jabra Elite Active 65t.  
  
First, please open the Jabra Sound+ app on your phone, you should find the screen below.  


  
Next, tap **Discover** at the bottom center of the app, and then tap **Voice guidance language**.

  
Finally, select your current language, and then tap **Update Now**.

After this step, follow all onscreen instructions, and be sure to accept the End User License Agreement. At the end of this process, you will be instructed to return the earbud to the charging case. You will see a purple light flashing near the USB port on your Jabra Elite 65t charging case. When the light stops flashing, use the earbuds and test them once more.",4

The iOS operating system is god awful. I think those that argue the iOS 'just works' and is intuitive have rose coloured glasses on.

What I will say though is the app experience on iOS is very good, particularly tablet apps. That's about all I have to say that's positive.

Settings is a mess, where it's constantly a struggle of finding settings in app or in the device settings. The categorisation doesn't make sense. The home screen can't be sorted. Apps can't be in a folder AND in the dock. Apps control default behaviour, not the system, so one app might open chrome or Google maps, where another will open Safari and apple maps. Touch ID is slow. Multitasking is inconsistent between side by side and floating use. No consistent way to 'go back'. Phone apps that aren't set for iPad  are terrible. No way to force landscape mode. FaceTime is prone to weird errors such as video being upside down. I could go on but there isn't much point.

To me as a late arrival, iOS is a simple OS that has become heavily featured with continual add on features. It needs a serious ground up rethink. Whereas android started as an overfeatured functional mess and has been refined to an intuitive powerful experience.",1

&gt;In other words, the photo you end up with from using Moon Mode might not be “your” photo, but instead a hybrid of your photo and artificial augmentations.

&gt;To test out this theory, Yue photographed the moon from several different angles as well as photographed non-moon objects using Moon Mode. You can read his full report here, but the basic gist is this: Moon Mode doesn’t appear to create fully original photographs.

&gt;It should be noted that Android Authority wasn’t able to confirm nor deny Yue’s findings. Android Authority has reached out to Huawei for comment on the situation..."" 

and I'll add that Huawei responded, basically stating that it works as advertised and replacing would be infeasible because you would have to store *a lot* of photos for the alleged 1,300 situations that the AI recognizes.

My opinion? It's entirely possible that **the photos of the Moon** could be augmented/replaced with a fake. I have two reasons:

1. Wang Yue did not accuse Huawei of replacing photos for every AI-recognized scenario so I don't know to whose accusation they responded to;

2. In China it is acceptable, even encouraged, to use every means possible to win. Stealing intellectual property is not immoral as it is in the West. It's exactly the reason why all top multiplayer games nowadays are *plagued* with Chinese hackers. Ask players of PUBG, Fortnite, Apex - they'll tell you. (Some companies deal with this by outright banning Chinese IPs from global servers and putting them into a Chinese-only server  like some kind of ghetto.) OnePlus, whose device I'm typing this on right now, has cheated on benchmarks more than once.
ZTE was even banned from doing business in the US for some time. Huawei has much more dirt behind their ears, and we know they're bent on becoming the No. 1 smartphone manufacturer in the world, so the motivation is definitely there. IMO, it's naive to dismiss this possibility.

We both got a White Pixel 3 at the same time due to a really good carrier deal here in Australia.

**Main Positive impressions:**

The still photo camera is obviously the main drawcard. Nothing much needed to be said but I do love the full res backup on Google Photos.

I like the feel of using current Android. It's way more slick than Android the Galaxy S3/HTC One M7/Xperia Z2 which was the last time I used Androids. I was getting tired of the staleness of iOS.

No notch on the small Pixel 3 + almost the same size as my old iPhone = win.

USB-C is better than lightning.

**Negatives:**

Video quality is hit and miss. On about 75% of my videos there is a noticeable lag or frame rate skip in the first 3 seconds of the video. Very annoying, especially if I'm trying to a capture my kids spur of the moment. Quality feels about the same or worse than on iPhone 7.

Call quality is just plain poor. Never have I had a phone where I've considered using a different phone or even a wifi WhatsApp call to avoid using  4G cell calling. On too many occasions I've had the caller on the other side say ""sorry I can't hear you"". My wife experiences this even worse than me as she uses her Pixel for work calls. A number of times I've been glad I carry my old iPhone as a work phone which is not a great advert. It's not frequent enough that I would pursue RMA but frequent enough to be frustrating (I'm not confident I'd get a better unit either). I've done a lot of googling and haven't found a consistent reason as to why it happens amongst other Pixel users other than it's probably software.

I don't have the safety net of an Apple Genius Bar warranty replacement or repair by going into a store (which is really good in Australia), contributing to why I don't want to go through an RMA process for the above.

**Summary:**

I really do like my Pixel but those two major negatives have caused me to have doubts over having a Pixel in the long term. My wife is pretty set on changing either to a Galaxy or go back to iPhone when the new ones launch later this year. I hope the call issues resolved over time with the monthly software patches.",6

I will never buy my kids things just because they want it. I’m not saying never get them anything but my parents would cover a majority of the shoes my brother was obsessed with. I’m not trying to say my parents were horrible. (Which they weren’t they both gave us very nice things.) But my brother would always have this odd obsession with the shoes he wore to school and would want new ones a little over a week after he just got some. My parents didn’t always get them for him because we don’t have infinite money. But he had gotten more than I had. I would always think (this is a legitimate claim) that I could buy the parts to a computer with the money they spent on him. A little after he got away from his shoe obsession and he got into Fortnite (ugh) he played it on ps4 at first and my parents took that away for good. (They did punish him at first. I’ll explain more later.) They took the ps4 away because he played it constantly (it was a shared console) and he started acting very mean and just wanted to play fortnite. At this point I got into fights with him because I wanted to play the psVR but he wouldn’t let me. They blamed it on both of us but it really stemmed from his obsession. He started to play keyboard/mouse to get around it and he continued to play nonstop. He was playing on a 10+ year old computer that could hardly run the game. For his birthday that year he wanted a new graphics card so that his computer could run better. My parents didn’t want to get him that because my dad wasn’t stupid and knew the whole computer would need to be replaced eventually. They weren’t going to spend $1200 on a computer for his birthday so they got him an Apple Watch. He didn’t like watched and would never tell my parents what he wanted after they told him they would get the graphics card so they got him that. He immediately decided he didn’t want it and he wanted to return it. All he wanted then was the new graphics card and was mad for an hour. After an hour my dad decided that ‘to be fair’ he would give me the Apple Watch since I paid for half of my computer ($1000 gaming laptop) The watch was $300 and they went and bought him a brand new desktop and monitor for $1500. Don’t get the wrong idea, I was grateful to get the watch but they bought him that which just fed his fortnite obsession. By this point my parents stopped punishing him because he would throw a fit whenever he didn’t get his way. They started leaving him at home when he didn’t want to go to dinner as a family. He got the idea to quit soccer. (My parents didn’t let him) and he just locked himself away in his room. He had to buy things for his computer since they were much more expensive. Since I know a lot about computers and technology he constantly annoys me with what should he get for his setup when he has nice things already. He had a top tier gaming mouse and mid tier headset with a top tier keyboard and TWO monitors. After that all he could talk about was how his setup was so bad and needed new stuff. It irritated me so much because I wanted to build a computer at the level of his and that had been my dream for years and he just got it. I would never ask for computer parts since I had too specific wants and I got a job to do it and started saving. He also picked on me for having a computer that was ‘trash’ when it was just a laptop that was a couple years old. This still happens today and it’s gotten to the point where he is so obsessed with himself that every year he has to ruin my birthday. It was to the point that I had to make him stay home one time because he was being so mean. Another cause of his selfishness was that he got things the same year I did. I’m over a year older than him and every year at Christmas when I was allowed to get a new thing (mostly electronics) he got them too. He got a phone, iPad, android tablet, iPod, new phone etc. the SAME year I did. This caused him to be mean to everyone, family, teachers, friends (they thought it was cool). He was even mean to when he would ignore his Grandmaw when she tried to talk to him. This all created a bunch of hate and arguments in my family that still happen.

I unfortunately have to use an iPhone for work, but I hate it so much I still pay for a personal phone as well. The main reasons are as follows:

* The iOS UI is beyond awful; the keyboard alone makes me want to pull my hair out.

* I have never encountered an iPhone that didn't die after about two hours of mild use. I use my work phone to scan barcodes and place orders for customers. If I hadn't bought a battery case, I would have to stop and recharge my phone after every stop on my route. My Android on the other hand goes a full day easily with pretty much constant use and charges in about 15 minutes.

* iOS gives up on user-friendly ideas in the name of never forcing it's users to learn something new. It doesn't work anyway, and then you're just behind on innovation. Android, on the other hand, is always bringing new things to their devices and all it takes is about twelve seconds of reading to learn how to use them if you can't figure it out.

* If I've learned anything from people that actively hate Android, it's that they know very little about technology, by and large. They tend to not realize that Androids have a bit of a learning curve if you were to switch, but only because they can do so much more. It's not even remotely hard to figure out.

* iTunes, all I'm going to say.

* Most of the *official* iOS apps are a clunky, ugly mess. The Podcast app is hideous and harder to use than, say, Castbox. Apple Maps leads you all over the place and usually points you in the wrong direction, especially in even vaguely rural areas. They just suck, straight up. Spotify is also a travesty on iOS.

* Their so-called amazing cameras can't focus on an object a few inches away in fairly well-lit rooms. I have to use my camera to scan barcodes, as previously mentioned, and it can take me a long time to find the perfect angle that the phone will accept. It's just pitiful.

This is just my own experience, but I've been forced to use both for a while now and I can honestly say that Android is way better for anyone who wants a better, more customized device over flashy gimmicks and a simple-to-the-point-of-being-a-hindrance UI.",4

This isn't a smartphone, but was my first foray into smart devices. Thought about getting an iPhone, but couldn't really justify the price for the features I would use
* **HTC ThunderBolt** \- 2011. I liked this phone a lot. It was the first 4G LTE phone on Verizon, and I liked HTC's UI/OS. I ended up rooting it and experimenting with a lot of different custom ROM's. Between that and playing a lot of games I pretty much killed the battery so I loved the ability to remove and replace the battery. I probably would've kept the phone longer, but I had a single nasty drop (after sooo long of not dropping it at all) and the screen was terribly cracked. I tried replacing the digitizer+screen, but ended up damaging some components
* **iPad 2** \- 2011ish. Received this as a gift. At the time I think Apple was on top of the tablet game by a decent margin. I would have preferred an android tablet since I wasn't a fan of Apple/iOS, but beggars can't be choosers. I actually liked the iPad quite a bit, jailbroke it and installed cydia so I got a lot out of it. I was traveling a decent amount around this time and always had it loaded up with movies/TV shows for flights which was clutch
* **Samsung Galasy S3** \- 2013ish. My first foray into Samsung phones and I liked how the phone looked at the time, especially how thin it was. Again, I liked the replaceable battery. Solid phone overall. Wasn't a huge fan of TouchWiz, but it grew on me over time.
* **Samsung Galaxy S6** \- 2015ish. I liked my S3 so this was the next logical step given the lackluster (IMO) smartphone competition at the time, at least on Verizon. Again solid phone, but unfortunately I ended up losing the phone in Hong Kong while on a business trip. I wasn't using a case at the time and it just slipped out of my pocket in a cab. I didn't notice till I got out and the cab sped away, tried to run after it, but no dice.
* **Samsung Galaxy S7** \- 2016. Great phone, more of the same from the S6, but better. I loved having the headphone jack despite Apple and some other manufacturers getting rid of it around that time. Around this time I feel like Samsung really stepped up and exceeded their expectations. My only major complaint was poor battery life. I probably could've held out on an upgrade longer, but I was tired of needing to charge up \~3 times per day. It got to the point where I wouldn't even think of leaving the house unless it was at 100%, and even then i'd have to bring a power pack.
* **iPhone 8** \- 2018. This is a work phone I currently use. For someone who doesn't like Apple/iOS much, this is a surprisingly solid phone. Gets the job done, and although it has large bezels, I think it looks and feels great. I'd prefer an android phone, but mostly to reduce the number of chargers/cables I need to carry around. 
* **iPad Pro** (not sure what model exactly) - 2018. This is a work tablet. I rarely use it to be honest, but it's solid overall.  
* **Samsung Galaxy S10** \- 2019. Amazing phone. Once I saw the finalized version of the phone I knew I would end up upgrading. The cameras are great, love the full screen display (don't mind the camera hole one bit), and love the feel of the phone whether it's in a case or not. Although I don't use it much, i'm very glad Samsung decided to keep the headphone jack. My one complaint is with the fingerprint reader. It's tough to tell where it is when i'm not holding the phone (I like to unlock it while it's sitting on my desk) and fails to read too often for me to rely on it. After about a week I switched to the face unlock which has been extremely responsive, and I don't mind the reduced security.

Being able to use competitors if I do not like a new phone. Being locked to apple means you are stuck with expensive phones. (fuck the iPhone R with $800 LCD screen! you are being hustled out of money people)

EDIT:  More stuff:

I can edit the heck out of my phone, all the way to animation speeds and whether I want to allow split screen on apps that do not normally let you do that.

I can buy any accessory I want, and cables that work with everything....I do not need a dongle to connect my new iPhone to my new Macbook pro (lighting cable to usb-c adaptor)

My phone plays nice with all other gadgets. I can use Wifi-direct to connect to printers, laptops, and ANY BRAND PHONE. Iphone's airdrop only works with apple products.

Dual sim for life! No dual sim? that's ok, just add an SD card in there.

Can transfer images from drone to phone using SD card very quickle.

I used to have samsung phone, I loved the edge screen short cuts. Now with oneplus I have offscreen shortcuts to turn on camera or flaslight.

Fuck the notch! and fuck the android phones (Pixel) that followed apple's bad decision! Also, I laugh my ass off at apple's iphone images...they have a dark background to hide the notch! Even they know it sucks!

Amazing costumer service! I just got out of a 3 month battle with Samsung for them to replace a Note 9 that was defective. I swore not to use Samsung again for that. Apple would have quickly replaced the phone.

If it can run efficiently while managing a dissonant mess, it’s still doing its job.

Sure, but that’s not what it’s doing, is it?

The link in the OP does talk about several optimisations that would improve on the current state a bit, but how are you going to stop background task spam without using any sort of restriction?

&gt;	Ok but one of Android’s biggest selling points is “freedom”. That’s one of the reasons why we’re not seeing a lot of innovation on the iOS side of things these days.

And what’s the innovation going on on Android side of things? New permissions API and background process management? Sorry to tell you but those are pretty clearly inspired from iOS.

&gt;	Who’s “they”? Are you talking devs or Apple?

Apple. Obviously iOS is lacking some stuff, it’s not like they’re the paragon of mobile OSes.

&gt;	Ok... show me a “Tasker for iOS” that has 100% feature parity... I’ll wait.

Which is an app used by a majority of smartphone users, is it? Like I said, outside of some niche use cases most apps are covered by the background states allowed by iOS.

And about Tasker, considering that Shortcuts is now a thing, Apple is probably going to add a way to enable timed tasks in some form sooner or later.

&gt;	That’s one of the reasons why you’ll never see an iPhone 8 doing what a Galaxy S8 can do via DeX... replacing a low/mid spec Mac or PC.

Point taken, but that’s not what it was meant to do in the first place.

&gt;	Apple’s memory management is a strength as long as the context is mobile but the hardware is good enough to go beyond that and become a do-everything device for the average consumer. IMHO, that’s the next evolutionary step in consumer tech and Apple just can’t go there without making some rather dramatic changes to iOS’s fundamental structure.

Accepted, but...

&gt;	Android is going there as we speak.

I have used one myself... still not a fan. 

The UI totally tries to copy iOS. That would be cute if they actually improved on iOS, but like many cases of Chinese IP theft, its just a watered down imitation without any of the benefits. Huawei cannot compete with Apple's ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, and etc). They incorporate unpopular choices like the lack of an app drawer. 

Even worse than that, their changes actually regress Android compared to stock Android or other popular options like Samsung's One UI. They nag you incessantly to enable HiCare. After installing a new custom launcher, you have to dive into Settings to enable it. Samsung, Google, OnePlus and others allow you to switch with the next press of a home button. Their battery saving mode is way too aggressive and makes the phone close apps like it has a single gigabyte of RAM. You have to turn off this aggressive RAM culling for each individual app.


Tech reviewers have noted problems like incoming notifications freezing the UI, context menus being oddly barren, alarms randomly failing to go off. Huawei refuses to implement the dual partition scheme that makes software updates faster and less risky. This dual partition scheme would also make reboots literally 60 seconds faster. 

The criticism of EMUI is well noted, although I'm glad you enjoy the Honor 10 regardless. 

These criticisms cannot be dismissed because you're salty the Big Four US carriers refuse to sell Huawei devices. An engineer from Huawei literally stole a robot from T-Mobile, they pursued trade secrets from Apple, they stole source code to build wireless routers from Cisco. Samsung poured millions of dollars and thousands of engineering hours into foldable phones. Huawei stole this tech and attempted to beat Samsung to the market. The company has a long and proud history of IP theft, and they're rumored to leave security holes in their devices for the Chinese government to use.

Price. I'm a college student paying for my own phone, the newest iPhone is far too much for the lack of actual specs. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful phone, but I cannot justify the price with the small margin of performance that it gets over the OnePlus, let's say.

Lack of limitations of devices. I can use any other product and be fine, Apple is limited to Apple, and that really sucks. Want a proprietary, universal cable? Android has you. Apple? Not so much. Lightning cable on the phone without a lighting cable or even USB on the MacBook is still laughable to me, and the outright blatant marketing gimmicks to keep raking in money makes me doubt anyone claiming they're tech savvy to prefer Apple products when dealing with something more intensive than, say, basic app usage. 

I fully understand the appeal of Apple, though. It hardly changes, there's nothing new to learn or figure out, you get what you expect, and it has everything any basic phone user would need out of a phone: great camera, great optimization, (arguably because of notch) great look. It's just pushing past the basic is when the fork hits the road. 

Lastly, and going along with the Apple appeal, the ability of having so many different Android builds is what ultimately makes me love it more. Sure, the optimization is not always there, and that's something that needs to get better to really convert the die-hard Apple fans. But at the end of the day, if I don't like the notch on the new Google Pixel 4 that is supposedly coming out, I just go and buy the Huawei P30 Pro, or the OnePlus, or the Samsung S10. If you're Apple, that choice is gone. It's only the same looking phone with the same features, albeit some missing on the budget model. At the end of the day, though, that doesn't change the fact that it operates in the same aesthetic shell, and uses the same software.",4

\- Cooperation between Sony divisions is essentially non-existent (or, at least between Sony Mobile and other Sony divisions). There has been many attempts to fix (or pretend to have fixed) this, and while this would have been good for the mobile division there usually isn't too much incentive for the other divisions to open up as long as they do fine on their own.

\- Marketing is doing an extremely poor job and/or is completely under financed. This is partially due to the Sony brand selling itself in Japan, but not so much in the rest of the world. An interesting tidbit here is that a few years ago, an advertisement performance evaluation showed that a majority of viewers thought that ads for Xperia devices were in fact about Apple or Samsung phones...

\- The company culture (at least nowadays, it was different in the mid 2000:s) has a built-in risk aversion mind which is borderline absurd. 100% of the time will the ""safe"" strategy be chosen even if that means a slow but guaranteed death. Sony mobile has, for several years, had an open market window with compact devices, but this is always deliberately being kept small due to fear of cannibalizing on other models. There has also been, technically very successful, attempts with devices with basically stock Android and thus minimal software development costs but those initiatives have been killed and buried due to inter company politics and a fear of alienating network operators by launching stock android devices much faster than ones with heavily customized software.

\- The company has a mindset that devices are sold to network operators (carriers), period. This means that there is never really an attempt to figure out what the end customer wants. Operators dictate the requirements completely, and according to the strategy planners, this is a law of nature. It's funny, because Apple very clearly disproved this law over ten years ago by launching the iPhone that was clearly not built on operator specs.

\- The strategy division is extremely focused on the Japanese market, which is very different from the rest of the world.

\- In 2012, the headquarters (and much of the executive power) moved from Sweden to Tokyo. Prior to this, Tokyo development mostly did their own thing, but now decision making roles for all of the company started to move to Japanese executives and managers located in Tokyo. The impact of the massive cultural (not to mention geographical) gap here cannot be overstated. And at roughly the same time, there were some notoriously incompetent executives creating havoc in the Swedish part of the company. The notion that software development is in no way different from factory production was stated in all employee meetings on more than one occasion. A one time CEO was shown a phone with a stylus, pulled the stylus out and asked ""Is this the antenna?"". If I remember correctly the last one actually happened a year or three earlier but still.



It's so sad that a company that theoretically has everything going for itself can fail and continue to fail so miserably. A few years ago there might have been a possibility to take control of the situation, but the only remaining alternatives today are to either cut costs and hope for a miracle or to simply roll over and die. A systematic problem is that top management teams, who are the ones ultimately responsible for taking control, just have to keep the company afloat for two years or so before they can cash out and move elsewhere. There is no incentive at all for risk taking, just the opposite.

Yeah, the size is right, but *nothing* about it is comfortable.  The UI drives me absolutely crazy.

* With Android I have a real filesystem I can access and organize things the way I want.  I have a real file browser for that filesystem that can seamlessly access network shares, cloud storage, FTP/FTPS/SFTP, webdav, etc., all right in the same place.  Think mapped network drives on a PC.

* I never even have to plug my device in to transfer files.  When I want to put a few new audiobooks on my phone, I just hit the windows share from the above mentioned file browser and copy them over.  Seamless, simple, don't have to plug in and ""sync,"" etc.  I bought a Pixel 2 XL in February of 2018, and I haven't actually plugged it into a computer once.  On the other hand, I've plugged in a USB-C hub, mouse, and keyboard to do some old school gaming - it all worked without having to configure a single thing.  Completely seamless.

* I can easily set up my phone to back itself up daily across my wireless network to my NAS.  I never even have to think about it.  I just get a notification if it fails, otherwise all data from my phone is incrementally backed up.

* I have unlimited photo storage in Google Photos cloud, which at this point has photos going back to 2009 with my first Android.

Aside from the above, there is just nothing compelling for me.  I understand iPhones are dramatically more powerful, but I'm not even beginning to stress what I already have, so that's just not a selling point.  The screen may be higher quality, but in looking at them in comparison I realize that with my 37 year old eyes I don't see any compelling difference.

We had an extra room at the time, so we decided that we'd let them stay.  They were pretty nice, but had kids.  Their oldest son, let's call him Jay, would come and stay over from time to time.  (I don't remember exactly how old he was, I was about 14 at the time, and I think he was somewhere between 19-21) At first my family didn't mind him coming over, and we all thought that he was a pretty good guy too.

Well, after the week had passed and I went to get my phone, it was gone?!  I thought that that was weird, and went to my stepdad to ask where he had put it.  He said it was next to his chair, and when I showed him that it wasn't, we went searching the house.  He ended up asking his friend if he knew where it was and, since Jay was here the night before, if he could ask Jay where it was.  His friend ended up getting really mad, wondering how we could accuse him, or his son, of stealing something so valuable, we've known them forever, blah blah.  They ended up arguing for a bit and my stepdads friend ended up texting Jay asking if he knew where my phone was.  Jay responded saying that he accidentally grabbed it thinking it was his phone (he has an android?) and said he'd bring it by tonight.  When I finally got my phone back, it was restored to factory settings, and I was pissed.  This phone had so many pictures of my family, all my contacts, notes, art, it was just gone.  Jay apologized and said that he must've done that when he continually got my password wrong (I did not have my phone set up to reset itself if the password was entered wrong too many times because I was 14, I had nothing to hide) and then he just left the house.  About an hour later I started getting texts from this random number, asking where I was, and how much was it for the phone again?  Needless to say my blood was boiling.  I let my stepfather know and he told his friend to never let Jay in our house again.  His friend promised he wouldn't, but he did let Jay sneak in after we had all fallen asleep.  Jay ended up ODing in our bathtub about a month later.  And my mom had gotten up to use the restroom and almost lost her heart at what she saw.  We called the ambulance, and then basically gave everyone a week to move out because we do NOT allow drugs in our house (I was the oldest of my three sisters).  They moved out but left a lot of junk.  We told them we'd give them a month to get the stuff and if they didn't we'd throw it out.  They didn't, and we ended up going through all of their stuff to find a multitude of drugs hidden in food packages like gushers and stuff.  Our family hasn't really spoken to them since. 

TLDR;  we invited a family friend into the house, his son ended up stealing and trying to sell my iPhone and ODing in our bathtub.  My stepdad then found a lot of drugs in their room after they were kicked out.",3

And honestly, the watch experience is something that will keep me in Apple's ecosystem for foreseeable future. This is exactly how wearables should be done. 
  
But, one thing is, Apple will never make Apple Watch compatible with Android, because of vastly different way it operates. The integration between iPhone and Apple Watch is insane. All health info goes into Apple Health, which also allows my digital scale to add data there. Android has no equivalent. So no way to see, in one place, your calories spent, your average heartbeat, all your fitness activities and your body measurements. Or the fact that if my watch is locked, I can unlock it just by unlocking my iPhone.
  
Another big thing is, apps. If iOS app has Watch companion, it automatically gets installed on Apple Watch. You can remove it if you wish, but apps will be there. And they do communicate with their ""main"" app on iPhone. For example, my August lock app. If I need to lock/unlock it via watch, I go to it's app, push Unlock, and it tells my phone app to unlock the door.
  
Or, another example, Spotify. When any music/media plays, playback controls are on the watch, just like they were on my Gear S3. But if I play something with Spotify on the phone, companion Watch app auto-launches on the watch. From there, I can like/unlike, select different playlist, and so on. Again, communication between phone and watch that keeps telling what's used where, is important. 
  
So, with Apple being all about user experience, I doubt they will release a product with inferior experience to their own ecosystem. If that does not generate them money (Watch will be one-time sale), there's no point to cross-platform it for them. Apple Music has subscription, so this is the reason they released it on Android. With watch, I am certain it's more than just ""drinking their own Kool-aid"" but more about what is possible and not possible with Android.",1

I really like them both. My two cents:

The S10 hardware is a definite improvement over the S8+, so it's One UI vs the old Samsung Experience.

However the main difference you will perceive between your iPhone X and a potential S10 is the ecosystem and how apps work and behave, you might have heard it before but it seems that a lot of developers work iOS first and Android second, regardless of marketshare. It's about revenue and audience (not in a wider sense, a more targeted one, markets such as US).

So if you didn't like how apps or the OS worked at a fundamental level with your S8, things are pretty much the same. One UI is a great improvement and I enjoy it a lot but also consider that iOS 13 seems that will be a good improvement as well (dark mode at last - Apple seems to be behind the curve all time but at the same time they usually nail their first implementation better... ignore Apple Music on that).

Overall, it will depend on how comfortable you are with the whole iOS environment and how effortless you want everything to work. If you aim for the least effort to get things done, iOS might be better. If you'd like to mold the OS to your liking and can endure a bit some inconsistencies between apps or actions and prefer robustness and customization, you will surely like Android/Samsung better.



1 - Warranty might be a bit tricky, hope someone else can chime in but Samsung's warranty is nowhere near as effortless as Apple. I could be wrong though but that's my impression from forums.

2 - Get Snapdragon if you can, seems to be better overall.

3 - Again Snapdragon might have better radios/modem.

6 - Updates seem to be a bit slower when it comes to Unlocked variants, it has been like that with the S8, sometimes lagging a couple of weeks up to a month behind. Beware on that.",4

- USRP B210  (with antennas and cables (USB 3) to connect to PC)
- A smart phone/or an old GSM phone. In case of Google Fi, we have the IoT device here inste.
- A SIM card
- A laptop

And software :

- OpenBTS
- SipauthServ
- Smqueue (Optional – if you want to play with some SMS messaging)
- Asterisk (Optional – if you want to play with making calls)
- And ideally OS – Ubuntu 16.04 

So let's get started:
I followed this link for building the OpenBTS from source. There is usually some missing dependencies to fix. Apart from that, there is no specific setup needed for building OpenBTS. To get started, we mainly need two services which is OpenBTS itself and SipauthServe. After building OpenBTS and SipauthServe from source, start both the services in a terminal. In the above link, there is also other components such as Smqueue and Asterisk which is needed for making calling and SMS features working. But as our focus here is mainly on mobile data, (here GPRS), we don’t care about setting those components here. But it is still fun to try and get it working.


Running OpenBTS

Connect the USRP device to your computer with the USB 3 cable that comes with it.

In my case, I made a VM where I built all the required software to make it easy to port. When you have a VM, make sure you have USB 3 forwarding possibility. In virtualbox, you should be able to enable USB &gt; Devices &gt; Ettus Research USRP B210 (or some similar name. If you don’t know the right name, do dmesg to figure out.)

 uhd_usrp_probe : Use this command – USRP Hardware Driver Peripheral Report Utility for linux – this will download the firmware for B210 once it detects the device.

Run SipauthServe

home/dev/subscriberRegistry/apps$ sudo ./sipauthserve

Run OpenBTS

home/dev/openbts/apps$ sudo ./OpenBTS

Run OpenBTSCLI

home/dev/openbts/apps$ sudo ./OpenBTSCLI
Configuring the Base Station
In the above step, you would have noticed running OpenBTSCLI. This is mainly for configuring our OpenBTS.
Below are the main configurations to be done in OpenBTSCLI for us to get a functioning model:

 Allow any phone to connect to the base station without any authentication. This allows registrations from any phone regardless of their provider.OpenBTS&gt; config Control.LUR.OpenRegistration .*

Enable GPRS

    OpenBTS&gt; config GPRS.Enable 1

Enable IP forwarding

echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Setup iptables : The whole GPRS and IPtables setup is found in detail here.

Getting the phone connect to the Base Station
If you have a smart phone, you have to change some settings to actually make the phone connect to the base station. This gets even more challenging when there is an IoT device in place as there is hardly any option to configure the “Mobile Network” in an IoT device. But we will get to that later.
Setting up an Android phone:
(Basically similar on iPhones.)

Enable 2G. This is downgrading to 2G from 4G: Settings &gt; Cellular Networks &gt; Preferred network type &gt; 2G

Add an APN : Settings &gt; Cellular Networks &gt; Access Point Names. When you add, make sure that the MCC and MNC are set as the same value as for the SIM card. In Germany, the MCC is 262. The MNC will change based on the provider. This is a link where you can find that out. Apart from that, the APN and Name value could be anything. Also, keep the authentication as none.

If you see the message, that your phone is registered on the network, then you can confirm that by checking in OpenBTSCLI.
OpenBTS&gt; tmsis
This will show the IMSI of the SIM card that registered to your base station. If you manage to do till here, you already have your first finding which is the IMSI of the SIM card. IMSI is the private identifier of your SIM card. An attacker with an IMSI can identify and track the subscriber’s network and can even try to perform impersonation.
Mobile data sniffing
Once GPRS is working, you should be able to see the symbol ‘G’ in the place where you actually see ‘LTE’ or mobile data symbol in your phone.
Try to google for something in the browser in your smart phone.  It is going to be super slow. Remember the old GPRS days. ￼
Open Wireshark in your OpenBTS VM.
You will be able to see the packets..
￼Figure 5: Sniffed traffic in wireshark
I guess I don’t have to explain further on how to place a Burp proxy for that interface.
We have a full MitM ready for hacking.. yey….
Thoughts on IoT
As we know, none of the devices today are going to use GPRS for connecting to its backend. It is either LTE or at least 3G. If the IoT device is small enough, the best idea to get it connect to our base station is by placing it in a faraday cage. In that case, there are no other signals available and the SIM card gradually connects to our base station. But this is not possible when the device is big like a car. (unless you have a garage with a faraday cage). One possible technique here is to use a jammer so that the SIM card actually disconnects from its original provider. Meanwhile we have our OpenBTS ready next to the device as soon as we turn off the jammer. Then pray and wait for the SIM to actually connect to us. This takes lots of trial and errors. But if we are lucky, we might get a working setup. Also, having a jammer that allows to selectively break only LTE and 3G might lead to downgrade attacks making the SIM connect to our 2G base station. Anyhow, I must say that these are not so easy in practice.
Note: Using a jammer is prohibited in many places. Make sure you can control the range and frequencies disrupted with the jammer. It has to be limited to your device that you are testing.
For those who are really interested in trying 4G sniffing, srsLTE must be interesting.

So a rename/move on same storage is instant then for the most part ?  When does it fail (or why does it fail) if it is on the same storage (I can understand if it is across storage - which would require a lengthy copy for a 1GB file).

I also agree with your comment that the advantage of SAF - that once implemented now it could expand access to ext SD card (albeit an artificial advantage which only remedies an earlier misstep of removing ext SD card access in Kit Kat in the first place).

Your comments confirm many of the points I was making.

&nbsp;

&gt;random reads went from about 200ms to 600ms in random read cases

File io is already a bottleneck - we don't need more bottlenecks slowing file io down with newer android versions.  A slower random speed would affect our app for instance (audio recording), because of the way we do things.  This means SAF is not a drop in replacement, but requires extensive restructuring beyond just API call replacement.

&gt;FFMpeg can write and write to pipes just fine and you can attach pipes to Input/OutputStream objects

I don't have expertise to comment on this - but if the code was doing fopen() directly, that would not be allowed in SAF, from my understanding.  This means a non-JNI developer indie dev has to go fishing in their third party library codes to fix them.  **Is that the burden a new top level API should impose ?**

&gt;This complaining is now really wierd, because Google was telling you to respect users for years and you didn't.

I hope you realize that Share is broken between apps - one of our apps interoperates with multiple file manager apps (some of which we recommend because they are especially accessible to our blind users which our app caters to), but there is no consistent share mechanism which will work across all old and new apps (thanks to the file:// change that Commonsware refers to).  So sometimes real-world apps don't have the luxury of moving from old ways of doing things because the new way breaks interoperability with the old apps they were supposed to work with (if those app devs have not updated their apps to new way).  This is a platform issue and not a dev issue.  Realistically Google should not be changing APIs and conventions in such ways that it breaks forward compatibility.

&gt;Not to mention that you can ALWAYS fallback to using your apps directory on external storage, which has NO access restrictions

This is not a solution, since this directory is removed on app uninstall.  The discussion was related to persistent storage, which Google has been eroding (doesn't hurt cloud storage).


&nbsp;


**Obtuseness of SAF**

That the specifics of SAF are so obtuse that they have to be found out in random comments on reddit is telling - whether it is performant on rename/move on same storage.

If I were to ask you how much was spent on porting your app that would be another data point confirming that such an activity is **not viable for a small dev** (it may be viable for a larger company, or one where an already profitable app is able to finance that effort - where they have the manpower to test a non-standard API).

Before ascribing blame to developers, more scrutiny should be placed on **why there hasn't been a mass migration of apps to SAF**.  Save for a few file managers, and a handful of apps, most apps on Google Play have avoided SAF ?  Is it all laziness, or is it a carefully considered decision by developers (and small devs esp.).  If SAF was the slam dunk, everyone would be switching to it, and praising it no end (such praise is lacking, and is usually the reverse).

When Google pushes a new SAF API that does not conform to standards, for which docs take a handwaving approach, it is inevitable that it's adoption will be abysmal.  Google has not provided performance specs, and a robust set of example code that would suggest they really want to push SAF.  Most of their docs and videos seem to gravitate around facilitating Google Drive.


So rather than blame the lack of adoption of SAF on developers, more attention should be placed on the API itself, whether it's design lacks something, or whether **it even solves a real problem**, or whether it has political backing.

As you may know, the removal of ext SD card access in Kit Kat in the name of privacy did not really pan out (when the whole internal storage was still open to clutter).

If SAF was provided as alternative - what did it achieve ?  Did it improve security/privacy ?


&nbsp;


**So what did SAF achieve ?**

From permissions on install, to run-time permissions, to SAF - how has the changing of the permissions screen changed between these approaches ?  Even now a malicious app could use SAF to do the same misbehavior.

**Clearly SAF was not meant to improve local storage access (which it hasn't improved) - it has instead fractured the seamless java/unix io standard.  All that Kit Kat move did was break a ton of apps' access to ext SD card (while allowing cluttering of internal storage to continue).  Similarly now how is SAF improving access to internal storage, if SAF still allows a malicious app to write everywhere ?**

The only thing SAF seems to be designed for is to level the playing field for cloud storage vs. local storage (by making local storage harder).",6

So yeah i will blame them untill they decide to actually listen to the people who do spend too much money on their half delivered products. If Sasmung and Huawei can do it (and chinese manufacturers) and challenge (effectively beating) apple, so can the company that owns the damn android.

PS. Also dont say that they don't have experience with building phones, they sure have some knowledge from Nexus line, cooperation with Motorola, LG, Samsung, HTC (especially now when they acquired them)...

I think dismissing such results is not the right thing to do.

The thing is that a smartphone such as the S10 isn't made for Average Joe specifically. It's made for everyone, and that includes some pretty high-end business and government customers. To take an extreme example: certain heads of state, including the current American president, have used Galaxy smartphones at some point during their tenure.

But even if the S10 was indeed exclusively for Average Joe, that doesn't mean that its high security requirements are lessened. Having access to someone's smartphone these days is like having access into their brain. Once you get to the home screen it's one touch to get to that person's email inbox, instant messaging conversations, calendar and more. Heck, even banking and password management apps are frequently only protected by just another fingerprint scan, which, hey, if you were able to fake at the lock screen, you should be able to easily fake again. 

In fact, Samsung is one of the few Android vendors that actually implements hardware-backed security and encryption into their devices. Samsung Knox is backed by ARM TrustZone which presents features similar to Apple's Secure Enclave design, and by a hardware fuse that is tripped when ROM modifications happen to the bootloader, triggering the wipe of sensitive data. Very few phones aside from Samsung's implement this sort of thing: I think the only other major Android vendor at this stage that does this sort of thing is Google, and they only do it for their latest Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL devices using the Titan chip design.

Those vendors are doing this sort of thing for a reason. The security of traditional laptop and desktop computers has been lacking since forever, and Apple made the right decision when they decided to radically, fundamentally redo device security when they came out with the first iPhone. The Android ecosystem is trying to follow suit but ultimately can't really to the same degree, due to market fragmentation and different providers for OS and hardware. 

This is all to argue that it is unwise to dismiss smartphone security. Even Average Joe has a lot to lose if his smartphone is unlocked. Samsung should work to improve its fingerprint authentication feature and should have simply removed its face recognition entirely from the S10 before release. ",4

I like Android WAY better than iOS, the main reason I’m using an SE now is because i started hating big phones and love the form factor of this SE.  If you’re ordering an XL then I’m sure big phones are not a problem for you.  

There’s so much simple, basic, stuff that makes Android better than iOS.  Like being able to place icons where you want, or being able to select ramping volume on the alarm clock.  Android is miles ahead of iOS.  

With that said, one big thing, is that I don’t really trust Google anymore.    It started when I realized my phone was sending info to google about every place I had ever visited and every move I made throughout the day.   

But even more recently, my Pixel 2, which I still use for an extra phone line I have, but it stays on my nightstand 90% of the time, popped with a notification “song playing:  (song)”.  It had listened to a song that was playing on the TV and identified for me.  The thing is, i didn’t ask it to, it just did it.  I poked around that particular feature and it had a “previously played songs” and it had a list of songs I would never listen to but i realized it had heard on my TV over the last couple of days.  Again, I never asked it to do this.  

So yea, you’re phone does listen 24/7.  I’d bet iOS does too, or at least some apps on iOS, because my wife gets FB ads about stuff we just talked about.   But at least Apple does seem to have some code of conduct regarding user privacy.  

TLDR:

1) Android is a way better than iOS (in my opinion anyway)
2) I like Android but I don’t daily an Android because I don’t like big phones and all androids these days are big.  I use an iPhone SE. 
3) Google scares me when it comes to privacy.",4

I made it clear doing any professional work that is better done on a workstation will not be good on a phone abundantly clear - you have the burden of proving me wrong - which you can't. 

&gt;I imagine these car doors leave screens intact? By a landslide, the most common issue is broken screens. A few hundred people is nothing in context. You use light and chinese as if they are insults. I don't get why for either.

Iphone screens are literally 2-3x as thick as android screens. It's much easier and CHEAPER to replace Iphone screens as well, due to the third party market. Samsung has total control over their replacement parts and brings the hammer down on any manufacturer that tries to create OEM replications. Again, another BAD thing about Samsung / Android devices. 

&gt;This ""old man"" is 28. You may be a teenager for all I know, but there is a world of difference between change and progress. Requiring additional technology, such as internet, to do something you can do already due to artificial restrictions is regression, not progression.

I'm older than you, and I'm also not as stubborn as you. Global wifi will be a thing in the near future. Mesh networked satellites are already providing internet access to extremely rural areas in third world countries around the world - as we speak. Elon Musk just sent one up over Southern Africa, for example. Keep clinging to the past.

&gt;What's your source for apps on the App Store earlier? I defy you to find anything you can find an app for on Iphone that isn't available on Android, yet Android has infinite apps Iphone doesn't.

A quick search for ""Exclusive App Store Apps"" on any search engine will provide you with more information that you would need for this request - if you weren't so lazy and stuck in the past you might have thought to do this. You probably won't find the information you need on Lycos.

&gt;Any device that forces me to use it the way the designer wants, including forced updates that brick my phone for an inconvenient period, is definitively worse than one that gives customisation and freedom. I've never encountered a problem using Android devices up to 7 years old, whereas Apple devices seem to constantly bug out.

Yeah.. I've literally never in my entire career with working on Apple devices experienced an update that bricked an Iphone. I can't say the same for Android. Again, because of the PLETHORA of hardware configurations - android devices are much more susceptible to hardware / software errors and bricking. 

&gt;Lol, another strawman. What, am I gonna work for ISIS in 10 years? I'm 28, as I said. The Venn diagram of people who want something on my phone, have the knowledge to bypass Android security and cannot bypass Apple's has no overlap.

Do you have a facebook or instagram account? They were storing your passwords in plaintext. I bet you use the same password for each online account you have, or at least something similar. I also bet you have access to your bank account on your phone, don't you? Security is a growing concern, not a shrinking one. And you are a fool to take that fact for granted. 

&gt;Last year, some idiot sold thousands of cans of Irish air to foreigners. Sales do not indicate a good product, just that marketing outperformed consumer intelligence. Look at the sales of ""Beats by Dr Dre"". Proven to have worse sound quality than headphones 1/4 the price, yet people bought them. Neither mean sensible earphones are going anywhere.

Anecdotal unrelated bullshit. 

&gt;Examples include waterproofing, wireless charging, dual cameras, large screens, fingerprint recognition, facial recognition etc were all available. Many of them were on the Note 4. Find me a feature (note, removing features doesn't count) that Android didn't do first.

High resolution screens, The Iphone 4 had a screen that literally doubled the resolution compared to any Android device at the time. 

The App store. The first of it's kind, and the Play store wouldn't exist without it.

The Iphone 5s was the first mobile device with a 64 bit processor.

The iphone was the first mobile device with multi touch capability.

Apple Pay.

3d / force touch.

Hardware level security / lockout chip. 

Funny you bring up fingerprint sensors, because before Apple developed and integrated them into their devices - no one used them, and they were absolute garbage.

Samsung phones at that price point have better specs and they do a fuck ton of advertising. There are dedicated Samsung stores for their phones. Think Apple store, except there are no Apple stores in India because they don't meet a specific legal requirement. There is virtually no reason to pick a Pixel over an iPhone or a Galaxy.

Nobody really cares about having ""the best camera on any phone"" when it comes alongside sub standard hardware and specs. And lastly, the midrange market is hugely competitive here. The Poco phone was designed for India. That gives you similar specs for a quarter of the price. How many people will pay 3-4x the price of a Poco just to have a better camera? You can buy a new Poco phone every year for three years and you will end up paying the same amount of money for far better hardware and longer updates than your one time purchase of the Pixel 3 which lasts three years.

The average Android OEM (Samsung included) takes at least 1 year to release OS upgrades and sometimes months to release simple OS updates which include bug fixes and security patches (from the date Google actually releases them). Devices older than 1 year have to wait even longer as OEMS are no longer motivated to keep those devices with the latest and greatest. What they really want you to do is to buy the new phone with the new OS. It is also extremely costly for Android OEMs to reprogram, test, support and deploy OS upgrades and updates. 

Always check with the OEM to see how long they plan to support the device. You may never actually see an OS upgrade depending on the phone you buy. 

Having said all this, Samsung is usually one of the better OEMs and they have recently promised it's customers to speed up upgrades and updates. Samsung is definitely a trustworthy company.

You can do a quick Google search to see which Android OEMS release upgrades/updates the fastest. Android Authority is a good source for anything Android.

The only exception is the Pixel phone of course. That is the only Android  phone that receives OS upgrades and updates instantaneously (like iOS).

Some Android OEMs are employing a new program called Android ONE. Under this program, the Android phones are guaranteed to receive timely updates (but not as fast as Pixel) and support for at least 2 years. Very few phones are under this program and I doubt Samsung will ever join it since it will require Samsung to use the Android ONE OS which would strip Samsung phones from all it's extra features.",4

&gt; The future addition to Android will redirect all your calls from an *unreachable* number to the working one [current **active** sim] on your device. Keep in mind that this will only happen if you have two SIMs in your device and only one of them is available while receiving the call. You will be able to trigger the functionality (and most likely switch the SIMs) from the UI. 


&gt; Smart forwarding is a feature to configure call forwarding to a different SIM in the device when one SIM is not reachable. The config here specifies a smart forwarding component that will launch UI for changing the configuration. An empty string indicates that no smart forwarding component is specified. Currently, only one non-empty configuration of smart forwarding component within [the] system will be used when multiple SIMs are inserted.


&gt; From the looks of it, specific carriers don’t **need** to add any support, or at least Google hasn’t mentioned that yet.


Imo, this is a great addition for Android users & carriers too. Eventually most phones will have Dual-sim capabilities & hence, when you're traveling overseas you wouldn't need to remove your existing Sim to use your phone/tab. In the past & depending on the devices today, swapping Sims would require the user to fiddle with APN settings & consequently to reload or worse reenter APN settings after leaving the foreign country.

We have had no issues and the performance has not decreased a bit (besides a small decrease in battery life which is to be expected with any phone).  

My previous 2 phones were a One M8 and a Galaxy S4.  Obviously those were older phones and the technology and reliability of Android greatly improved between those and the pixel, but I never want to use any other phone other than a pixel again.  I experienced extreme slow downs and other issues with both of those phones by the 2 year mark using them.  Stock Android on the pixel has been the best experience for me.

The only problem I've had is that the finish on the back of the phone has started to wear over time but that is hardly and issue for me. I've had no other hardware issues at all.

I can't speak for the Pixel 2 or 3, but I would imagine they work just as well and continue to improve on the og Pixel.

I plan on riding this phone out until it completely dies.  I wouldn't be too weary about switching, what you see on here are mostly very unique cases and problems that every phone manufacturer can have.  I could be wrong, but I find it hard to believe that a high percentage of pixel devices out there come with horrible defects or have problems early on.

Hope this helps! Once again, I can only speak for myself and the 3 other pixel users that I speak to often that have no problems.

Another E.g.  iPhones don't support mouse and keyboard support.  When I forget my laptop at home, it is still possible to connect a keyboard/mouse setup to my Android phone and get through a day of school.

Again.  The files system.  It's better.  You can actually transfer files from the device to another external device.

And again.  My 450$ phone came with a fast charger in the box.  That's awesome; 1.25hrs from 0% to 100% right out of the box is a gift.

Yet again.  Much better ecosystem for parts supplies and replacement components if you want to replace things.

Had issues with Waze being shut down when the screen was locked on EMUI (aggressive battery management). Having to choose  between Facebook draining 15% in the background or not receiving notifications at all (which caused me no end of headaches because I do use facebook a lot). Samsung didn't have any of these issues + little niggles that I didn't even know I was missing out on like bluetooth connecting more reliably, an interface that makes more sense(and lets me accomplish tasks more efficiently), and GPS reception being MUCH more reliable overall. 

I would say pick whichever you're leaning towards more. I went to samsung because I have grown to love the setup I have with Nova launcher as well as other apps I've found indispensible on the platform and I'm not 100% sure is available on iOS. The sheer versatility of Android, followed with the ability to pick default apps. Love YouTube Vanced (3rd party app) that lets me watch YouTube even  when the screen is locked, as well as having Picture in Picture mode for the odd multitasking need. Of course, I also love the fact that I have a headphone jack. Some people say it's ""ancient"" tech and I say fuck that. It does its job and does it well, and I'm not satisfied with the excuses they've made to justify it (I even wrote a basic research paper looking into this). Tech exists to serve me and my needs, I don't plan on bending over backwards while I still have some options available. The ""compactness"" of the S10e is something I love + I much prefer the old reliable fingerprint sensor to faceID. Its useful for unlocking my phone when I'm asking someone to send a text for me when I'm driving, where I don't need to look away from the road for even a second.


I like iPhones for their immense catalog of accessories, cases, etc. (notably lacking a lightning and headphone jack combo splitter that isn't huge and unwieldy). They usually have better app selection (though some areas are completely lacking because of iOS restrictions), and multiplatform apps do perform better on iOS most of the time. They have great performance and  (the XR) battery life, or at the very least standby time. But I prefer a more compact phone like the XS (but then it will cost even more). They last a long time, keep much more value as well. I wouldn't say they're niggle free though. I have had issues with connecting to wifi networks, bluetooth devices, mobile data etc. (I am the resident tech support for my family of iPhone users). I would say the gap is not nearly as large as they make it out to be, but it is there. However I've found that when something does goes wrong on an iPhone, things are *much, much* harder to find a fix for (if there even is one), that doesn't involve some reset, update that you have to wait for, or some archaic method that requires you to go through the whole damn thing manually (particularly photo syncing).

&gt; Why do you trust Apple?

It's not about trusting Apple specifically. In the context of Google vs Apple on privacy, I agree with the guy you're replying to. Why? **Google is an advertising company**. Their money is in big data. Almost all of the services and products that they develop and offer revolve around that in way or another. Apple, on the other hand, makes hardware and software first. They have only just gotten into services. In fact, Apple used to have an advertising platform called iAds. They killed it in 2016 after announcing it in 2010. 

So tl;dr it's the nature of how Google makes money vs how Apple makes money.

&gt; What makes you think that Apple won't ""alter the deal"" at some point? Apple has a history of ""altering deals"". For all you know, Apple could turn all of the data it collects over to anyone at any time, the overall effect on your digital privacy will be the same, and switching away from Apple won't undo that action. Apple may do this in underhanded ways as well so users won't pick up on the change until it's too late.

Alter what deal? Sell your data? Google already does this. For Apple, it would endanger their entire reputation. Ask Apple users why they use Apple products. Besides the fact that they're just popular, I mean. Privacy is a pretty big reason. Spare me the ""*no one I know says that*"", because your circle is pretty small compared to a large survey panel. Is Apple perfect? No. In China, they store iCloud data on Chinese servers instead of their own. But that's the cost of doing business. I'd bet anything that Google does the same. In fact, Google had/has been working on a not-so-secret censored Chinese search engine called DragonFly that even their employees came out against.

&gt; Corporations lie to consumers all of the time and Apple is no exception to that. Look at AirPower... Apple's top brass decided to announce to the entire world that their engineers knew how to make it work. They really didn't and kept quiet about that lie for over a year.

Are you really trying to pivot from privacy (which was the premise of the comment you replied to), to a failed product launch? Really? Straw man argument. 

&gt; They've recently lied through their teeth about iPad Pro bending issues and Macbook keyboard failure rates as well.

Absolutely agree with you here. Add the display ribbon cable in Macbooks from I believe 2016 being too short and causing the display to go wonky. But guess what - As a former Nexus 6P user, I went through 3 replacements before I made Google give me a refund. Why?

My town has a very significant amount of elderly people. They genuinely really liked me, and I had some clients who would stop in just to say hi when they were shopping at the grocery store nearby. I had this one elderly woman who would sit at the counter with me and talk with frequently. She had a little 8"" Android tablet that she got at Verizon, and had some troubles with. Typically we didn't sit and teach people how to use devices, but I would often be very bored (most of the stuff I did involved anti virus scans on ancient computers that could take upwards of a day and a half) so I sat with her and would show her things. Well, one day I noticed she had a Batman ring on her ring finger, and a Superman ring on the other finger. Apparently her husband proposed to her with Superman, and married her with the Batman ring. After that story we talked about comics, movies, even a little bit about video games. 

Eventually I had to move to go to college elsewhere, but...I really miss her and that place. Tbh if I could have coffee with her again it would make me so happy. I dont even know if she's even alive still, it's been about 7 years and I live in a different city. I hope she is though, and I hope she has great grandkids like she wanted. Ugh.

Aside from that, my managers were all extremely relaxed people. Well, the GM had some anger issues, but she liked me a lot because I worked hard and brought in a lot of repeat customers and traffic. My department manager was big into WoW and would sit behind the counter and chat with me when I wasn't with a customer and he wasn't too busy. He let me text because ""you're the kind of guy that just does what he's supposed to do. Why would I punish you? You get shit done."" 

My copy center friends were all genuine and great people, my cashier's were all sweet as hell, and even the cleaning staff was awesome.

* feel like camera was less hit and miss than Samsung (except for low light where Apple blows). Not to say the iPhone camera was better, it just gave solid results 99% of the time, while from my experience, samsung tends to give me either great pics, or blurry as hell pics.
* Polish of the OS
* iMessage

Things I love on Android -

* manufacturers less afraid of experimentation and innovation (even if it fails miserably or is gimmicky as hell)
* phone manufacturer options 
* exandable storage
* Samsung hardware and AMOLED display especially (though the iPhone XS display with that Sammy tech is pretty damn good too)
* endless phone customization options
* automation (see Bixby routines, Tasker app in Google Play)",4

Currently iPhone 8 owner. 

I'm just gonna go ahead and say don't do it. 

You're considering android only because of your curiosity to it. However, I don't think it's worth it for all the trouble this switch is going to bring, since you're very much fully integrated in the apple ecosystem. 

A few thoughts:
- my previous phones had all eventually run into battery draining issues. 
- expandable storage is nice, but you could also choose alternatives like storing photos with Google photo unlimited backup. Or just buy a highest storage version. 
- newer iPhones have telephoto lens, unless if you're looking for 50x zoom like the new Huawei P30 pro, which is amazing, but prized the same as iPhones.

If you're end up going android anyways, I'd say currently the following are the best options:
1. Huawei P30 Pro. Camera quality gets hideous sometimes due to overprocessing, but great night time shots and overall very complete package. 
2. Samsung s10. Very complete package. But you're bound to run into software problems resulting in glitching and slow downs in a few months. 
3. The next One Plus phone. The only down side is their camera. 
4. Pixel. I'm sure you've heard about the amazing camera as well as Night Sight, which is pure witch Craft. However, Google absolutely fucked it up as Pixel owners are now facing intense lags with certain tasks like launcher camera app.

My main reason though is that I don't like Apple's business practices:

They charge high prices for their iPhones  (£1000+ for the iPhone X?! I built my gaming PC for that much and I personally think that was a better investment)

On top of that, whenever they screw up (ie iPhone  4s signal issues, iPhone 6 bending) rather than coming clean with their mistakes they try to blame it on the customer (""No, you're holding it wrong!"" Etc) and then try to sell you an additionally overpriced product to 'remedy' the problem, or just outright sell you a new £1000+ iPhone.

Then there's the way that they make it incredibly difficult to connect their products to anything other than another apple product. (Also the lack of SD card port for quick data transfers (c'mon! It's 2019 dammit!) also annoys me)

Also the lack of standard features (and expandability) that literally every other phone/device on the market includes, and when they do finally cave into the pressure they make a massive song and dance about it as if they invented it.

The worst part for me though is the brainwashed fanboys. I once went on a bit of a low key rant in our university's Mac labs because I was tired of the quirks that made it awkward to use when you're a windows guy like me. (Fun fact: whilst Macs can read hard drives formatted with Windows' NTFS format, it will refuse to save files unless you have a 3rd party program installed to rectify this) A fan boy just across from me caught wind of this and spent the next few times we encountered each other telling me about Apple's 'amazing' design choices, like the way that they designed the Base of the Mac to be able to rotate on the spot by lightly pulling one of bottom corners. (As well as other things with his new iPhone X)

Sorry, spilled over into general computing products, but there you go. Sorry for the long rant/Essay)

I don't hate Apple, I just hate their scummy business practices. I'd like to see them improve.

As for your question though, it is hard to recommend just one phone cause the market in that price range is really saturated with many brands coming and going all the time. If you enjoy the software on the Nexus 5 you should look into phones with Android One support which is clean and pretty much stock Android with speedy updates. I haven´t used any of these phones myself (usually buying flagships) but I know the Xiaomi Mi A2 and Mi A2 Lite is pretty good options.

Nokia (newer models is Android One) and Motorola phones are quite good in this price range. One thing to say about Motorola (my sister have one) is that while they are pretty much stock Android they are usually slow with updating their phones and in the lower price range they normally just provide one big update. My sisters G5 Plus took 15-16 month to upgrade from 7.1 to 8.1 if I remember correctly, and this will also be the only big update that phone will ever get.

If you don't care for stock Android, and if it is available in your country you could always look into phones from Honor, which is a pretty good value for the money as well. Besides the brands I have mentioned there are many more out there which might be worth considering as well, but I hope I provided some brands and types of phones you should look into at least.

It's like Microsoft Windows, which I'm sure you use. Yes it's more open to viruses, but that's usually because people are irresponsible and install sketchy apps or apps from outside the playstore.

Is that correct? 

Correct. Android distributions are device-specific so you cannot typically just install a custom OS on a device. If your device is popular enough and has an unlockable bootloader you might be able to find a ""custom ROM"" for it. I can't really help here since you haven't told us what device you have.

&gt; And if so, is this tablet just useless now? 

Not really, but that's a ""you"" decision.

A lot of devices, even high-end devices like the Galaxy devices, come or used to come with software like that. T-Mobile and Verizon used to use a service called ""DT\_Ignite"" that acted in this manner but at least T-Mobile has since stopped (Verizon may have also, I just don't have a Verizon device anymore). It's not really a ""virus"" because it's not actively malicious. I would define it as ""adware."" It's installing these apps on your tablet because whoever made your tablet was paid by the publisher of those apps to have them installed on the devices they sell. 

You have a couple options:

1. Google the names of the preinstalled apps on your tablet, and see if you can figure out what app it is that's installing these other apps. If you can figure it out you can disable it, which would stop them from being reinstalled.
2. If you can't find it, or if it's locked from being disabled, you can just live with it. You can run a launcher like Nova Launcher and hide the apps.
3. You can overreact and throw the tablet out because of two apps on it.

The question is ""what harm do these apps do?"" If it's just a game or something, odds are it's not doing anything except sitting there on your device.

Now... the bigger issue would be the trustworthiness of the OS itself. It's very hard to tell what information the device might be capturing and sending back to some company in China.",4

It's a bit of a shock at first, because Apple tends to strip things back to their most basic form of simplicity. But after spending time getting to know Android and fine-tuning all the settings, I've really come to like it and enjoy using it.

However, there are things from iOS I do kinda miss, or just things in general that I notice are quite different between operating systems.

* **iOS has nicer animations.** At first Android felt quite 'stiff' or 'robotic' to me. It's hard to explain in words, but the general UI animations in iOS are much more fluid and giving. However, after spending some time tweaking things.. I've come to prefer the speedy animations that Android can offer. Really does make your device feel that much faster.

* **iOS does a better job at app updates.** Currently when updating your apps in the Play Store, it can only download one app at a time, and install one app at a time. Apparently this is meant to be changing soon so it's the same as iOS (probably with the next version of Android, I'd guess). Although, I do seem to think the installation process for Android apps are MUCH faster than it ever was on iOS.

* **Samsung Pay is really, really great.** I never really got to use much of Apple Pay when I was still using iOS, but the experience it fairly similar. However, it does seem that Samsung Pay is supported by more banks, and more importantly.. is supported at more places. The S10 series (as well as other previous gen Samsung flagships) not only supports NFC (what Apple Pay uses) but also has MST. This means that Samsung Pay will work pretty much anywhere, even on really old card readers.

* **You will miss iMessage.** iMessage is really hard to give up. Especially if you use it on your Mac too. It's great being able to see when somebody is typing, or send photos/gifs really quickly. Going back to the old way on SMS and MMS was a bit of a sea-change for me. Although with RCS Messaging become more of a prevalent thing, things should get better in the near future.

* **Android updates.. yeah.** Not getting a new update on Day 1 is also something get used to. It can also be really frustrating to find out that everyone in Europe or USA, or Asia etc has a certain update, but you living in whatever other country doesn't have it. Then it comes down to the carrier if they release that update first or not also, depending if you get a carrier-locked model. But hey, that's just how Android is.",4

A common user will see start to see error messages when the card goes south but it probably won't be apparent to them why. You won't lose data associated with just one app because adopted storage is encrypted and treated as an integral part of the phone - this means you cannot expect to remove it from the phone and read it from your computer to recover any media. You do not have the option to migrate working apps back to the phone. You have to start all over and possibly need to reset the phone in the process. If one is lucky, stuff you don't want to lose, like photos etc., can be copied off the phone with an OTG adapter and thumbdrive, but remember that depends on how persistent the errors are during the process.


Adopted storage is a nice idea but does not play out well in practice. It's really only a good option for a device that has very limited storage. An extra caveat - even if the card never goes bad - if you decide you want to get a bigger card, you STILL have to start over from scratch because of the way the device treats the storage. It is encrypted, unreadable, and of no use outside of the associated device until reformatted. You won't have the ability to selectively move apps back into the device and you probably wouldn't have enough room if you could anyway because that's why you got a card...


Can I make this sound worse? Yuppers. Android will prefer the adopted storage over internal storage. That means even if you did not choose to migrate your existing apps, newly installed apps will be placed on the card - not just on the card as needed as space runs out on the phone. If the card goes bad, it will be a worst case scenario because phone will have used the card as it's first choice for storing everything.

I wanted to buy two, one for me and one for my GF at the time, I was thinking on getting for Christmas.

But HP decided to abandon the tablet business 2 frigging months after they launched, they absolutely wanted nothing to do with the tablet market and needed to get rid of all inventory, so was the best way to get rid of thousands of tablets that are not gonna get any updates going forward? Do a fire sale. They dropped the price to $99 for the 16GB version and $149 for the 32GB version. 

I was just fucking around online on a Friday evening when I go to slick deals old forums and see if there are any deals for monitors as i needed one at the time.

As soon as i saw the thread i spent the next hour looking online, it was sold out everywhere, some people were just resellers buy either way they were sold out. I even drove to Walmart in the middle of the night. They had about 10 but their system hadn't been updated for the new price so I didn't buy them. I went back home and after a few more posts on slick deals someone posted a  link to a site that still showed some left in stock.  I bought 2.

  The only problem now was going to be their app store, I don't think they even had many apps probably fewer than 1000. Eventually someone figured a way to port android to it, so that is what I did. Installed android used it for a couple of years then gave it to one of my cousins.

So yeah. Overall I like my iPhone. But only because everyone else has one and it makes it easier to connect  and the whole ecosystem thing. 

Airplay and airdrop are very nice. Siri is retarded straight out. I use personal assistants daily and google was amazing compared to siri.

Fingerprint sensor on my 4-5 year old device used to work better than the iPhones. Even thought the receiver was scratched heavily. 

Water. Lol. That's gonna run you 90% of your devices price.

So I am currently an apple user of 06 yrs and before that I was on android for roughly two years. 

The thing with android is, with time and usage; it lags. I understand it’s a full fledged computer in your hands with the ability to make voice calls. But, like all computers it has its more than fair share of viruses, trojans, hacks. Now I am not saying this with the concern for piracy ( c’mon let’s face it, the government has access to everyone and everything) but with concern that it bloody slows down my phone, makes it lag, makes it unusable.

With Apple, it’s a phone. A phone with the ability to surf the internet, play songs, games, click photos and videos, and some office work. That’s it. That’s all you can do with an iPhone. And the synchronicity amongst it’s ecosystem  is seamless. I mean seam - fucking - less. You don’t have to do a thing, everything you have on your iPhone, is in your iPad and your MacBook, and vice versa. The operating system though with its faults is way smoother than anything any android has to offer (OnePlus does come pretty close). 

Google sync also pales in comparison with the ease of how apple can be set up. One id. Every fucking where.

My recommendation is to try out a free version of something to see if you are interested in pursuing yoga. If so, read reviews and try a paid app or version if you don't want ads. I think I've paid 3 times over the past 9 years (started this journey on the first iPad), totalling less then $30. Dramatically more than worth the value it has added to my life.

Every app I have used has had a version of 'Greet the Sun', usually a 10min warm up routine. That was all I did for years, 5-7 days a week. I've since added extra stretches and handstand exercises so that my morning exercise is between 10-30 mins, depending on how I'm feeling. 

As for your bum shoulder, I would recommend looking up injury specific exercise/physio videos and starting gently. I have been continuing my routine through different troubles for years. The past couple weeks I have been working around a toe injury. 

The trick is to stretch and work the muscles around the trouble spot without reinjuring, which may require shifting your weight to your left side while you build strength in your right shoulder, or whatnot. 

Try it out for 2 or 3 weeks to start and then take a step back and assess how you feel each day afterwards.

Here's my breakdown of your enthusiast wishlist:

* **something different**: pure enthusiast thinking. You spend a lot of time researching and thinking about phones, so you become bored/dissatisfied with the current selection and want ""something different"".  
Normal people on the other hand generally just want the newest, shiniest iPhone. or they want something like an iPhone if they can't afford one. Exact new features are not so important, unless it's something major like a bigger screen (one of the biggest recent functional changes which normal people really understood and desired was the shift from iPhone 5 → 6/6+ screen sizes - this was reflected in the rising popularity at that time of large-screened android devices, and why Apple made this move)
* **better screen**: your main market gambit is to try and convert iPhone users, and iPhones have perfectly good screens to normal people. On average normal people will not realize or perceive non-iPhones as having better screens, unless you carefully point it out, and it still will have a trivial effect on their buying decisions. They will probably notice if a phone has a markedly worse screen, so your goal here is to either a) be good enough or b) market with a catchy buzzword to try and drum up some awareness
* **better hardware**: The average person wants to be cool and fashionable. The average person has no clue what ""better hardware"" could mean for a phone, beyond knowing that it's annoying when a phone feels slow.
* **notch**: probably the closest you come to a real selling point. actually it is just a negative selling point. don't have an extremely ugly notch that you are embarrassed to show your friends.
* **wireless charging**: other than the fact that the P3/3Xl has this (maybe you didn't realize?), probably barely important beyond a bit of buzzword advertising. how many consumers have now tried wireless charging on iphones and consider it indispensable enough that a non-iphone would have to have it? i guess that population is not very signficant
* **all-around integration like RCS Messaging, Calendar Sync, and Assistant functionality**: what you have written here is completely abstract and 90% unintelligible to normal people.",6

Someone did mention iOS fan boys have also been getting mad at Apple for slacking but at least it's for hardware design they are way behind and it seems times have shifted Apple is now the one playing catch up instead of setting the standard and when I had my iPhone xs I was fine with that because it was stable and reliable.

It doesnt help that Google has a penchant for hiring young guns as product managers leading to a lot of half baked ideas from people who kinda sorta know what they are doing, but lack that extra something.



Google hasn't made a homegrown product that is really really notable in the past like, decade.  Android was an aquire, as was Youtube, Nest, etc.  The Pixel certainly is cool, but the rest of the cell phones/tablets they make suffer from a ton of back and forth, and the chromecast was a bit late.



Its a real shame because Google makes some real world class stuff and has absolutely amazing technology powering it that no one else can beat in every category, from hardware to software to whatever.  They just design everything around the core tech instead of designing it from the point of view as a customer, like Apple or amazon does.  Their products are almost invariably technologically superior, but suffer from really clunky design choices on the user facing parts, sometimes to accomodate the tech, other times because Google.

The main decision behind going all Apple is that I didn't want to shit on them without actually trying products. There is some good and bad stuff, but the things that convinced me to never buy Apple products on release have nothing to do with actual products:

1. Constant radio silence on issues apart from a small announcement when it really gets out of hand. This is silly and childish for me to want a company to expose their wrongdoings, but for me one of the biggest virtues that company can have is shedding light on issues, showing roadmaps on fixing them and taking responsibility. Apple is notorious for avoiding this and deflecting.

2. Said deflecting permeates the hardcore fan base very much. Every time I post about problems I had with my Macbook, I have people replying to me ""dunno, my keyboard works well and I use it as a fucking ashtray"". I'm exaggerating, but some Apple users are hardcore apologists, which makes holding a company responsible for its wrongdoings a lot harder for people who actually have problems.

For me the notion of ""Apple can do no wrong"" is so infuriating. It's a fucking company, not your friend, they will try to fuck you over at every possible moment, why are you defending them so vehemently?

They are not cross platform services, so it not as simple as you suggest.

&gt; Regardless though the point still stands, why not just install the apps she needs before mailing it? You could probably even log into everything for her if she gives you a username and password. 

This is why I pointed out that we also don't know ""if there will be any unforeseen issues or changes or something that will confuse her."" I was talking about things like app updates or system updates changing the user interface in some way, or doing anything unexpected (from her perspective) whatsoever. For example, she opens an update that got updated and it starts highlighting things on the screen to inform the user about new features, but she reacts to it as the phone doing something weird/different from what she expected. Same for things like accidentally swiping down notifications, accidentally triggering Google Assistant, or accidentally toggling a quick setting and then not knowing what to do. Some people's approach to technology is to create and follow written down step-by-step instructions, without actually understand what's going and what they're doing. So then when something inevitably changes, they have no ability to figure it out. I'm assuming from OP's post that his/her grandmother has either never used a smartphone/tablet before, or has only used them very little. In this situation, there are all sorts of reasons like this to put a remote access tech support tool on there, rather than merely installing a video chat client and leaving it at that.

&gt; Sure, but by that logic might as well not use android at all. Eventually google is going to kill android in place of fuschia. 

I'm aware of Fuschia, but given Google's track record on messaging apps, I don't know if Duo will stick around for the entire reasonable lifespan of her device (~2-5 years).

That said I'm switching back tomorrow. idk what happened with gen 2 AirPods, but they perform terribly outside in NYC even after a firmware update, and I just don't have confidence in Apple to fix it. On the other hand, my roommate (I sold him my GBs) reported that Samsung added ambient mode toggle as a control option, which is feedback I submitted several times over the month I had the GBs. So I have more confidence in Samsung updating the GBs to fix additional faults I had than Apple fixing the AirPods for Android.

Overall though I'd say it's actually not that puzzling why someone would go with AirPods even on Android. They're a really strong product especially if you don't live in a loud, chaotic place like NYC and don't need the isolation or have as much strain on the BT connection. It's honestly puzzling af to me that Apple doesn't support AirPods on Android officially.",4

With the Android phones I had, every day was different. Some days my D2G would go 18 hours without needing a charge, some days it was dead in an hour, with equal amounts of use. By the time I'd had it for nine months, it would consistently last about four hours, but take five hours to charge. The phone somehow always had malware on it. I'd buy an antivirus and it'd find a ton of stuff, and then I'd take it to the Geek Squad and they'd find just tons of crap in hidden folders. I really only used it for maps so I have no idea where I'd have picked that up. I was recommended the phone because I was traveling a lot and it was supposedly 'global', but it actually made it harder to travel. 

When I signed into my Galaxy SIII for the first time it automatically uploaded all of the photos on my phone to my Google Plus social media account (including nudes of exes) without prompting me or asking for permission. The battery didn't last long even though it was a major selling point for the phone. Every few months it would slow to a crawl and require a total factory reset. It was a decent phone when it was actually working but at $650 I expected something top of the line. 

I got the iPhone 6 and (surprise surprise) it just worked. It's starting to break down now after owning it for about four and a half years, and it's still more functional than my SIII was after less than a year of using it. About a month ago I bought an iPhone 6s+ and it's lightning fast and does everything I want it to. Plus, it asks for my permission every time an app has to upload something or access a hardware function its never accessed before. If I ever went Android again I'd buy a Pixel just because it's so Apple-like.",6

There was definitely a time where phones got bigger. Makes sense, after all battery life, power, screen resolution, screen to body ratio, screen quality all made steady gains. Huge phones would just be kinda shit in the early days of android.

But I'd say we reached a happy medium these days, even cheap phones are really good these days, and maybe some company flagships aside, there's a good range of all sizes.

And for what a phone is, a *mobile* device for your pocket, screens don't need to be huge. Phones, and tablets, aren't meant for work or ""serious"" media consumption like games, movies, etc. That's just not what they do, they are by and large devices for smaller tasks like relatively.ligght browsing, texting, etc. and they really don't have to be more than that.

Besides that, tablets stood to rival Laptops for the ""big screen"" tasks, but have largely fallen by the wayside. Laptops are way closer to ""real"" computers for ""serious"" tasks, and I'd say it's pretty clear by now that people aren't looking to replace them, even if you slap a keyboard on a tablet. It's a different category of device, there's really no demand for some sort of in between thing. Tablets failed because of that, and foldable phones will, too.",4

To me, the best part was just how customizable the OS was. I felt like I could actually personalize the phone to work for me. You can get different launchers, keyboards, icon packs, etc, and it was great. Apple technically has custom keyboards, but I had so many performance problems with them not loading, crashing, bringing up default keyboard instead of my custom keyboard, etc. Android is built from the ground up to support it, and it shows in terms of quality. The apps for it are pretty great, but honestly, I'm a pretty simple person who uses a handful of apps, and the ones I use are great.



The one thing that was a huge pain in the ass was moving away from iMessage. Holy shit does Apple not want to let your phone number go, and I'm hoping I'm just some rare case and it's easier for you. You'll need to make sure you go on your phone and disable iMessage, and go to Apple's website and also disable iMessage there. Even then, I found that anyone who messaged me would get errors and couldn't send me any messages, because they still thought I was on iMessage. Once I sent them a text, their phone would recognize I wasn't on iMessage, and then texting would work fine. I missed a bunch of messages in the transition, and people were asking why I wasn't messaging them back. Honestly, fuck Apple for how they dig your claws in, because that entire situation felt dirty to me. I've since switched to Telegram, because going back to SMS does indeed suck (no typing indicators or sent messages, poor pic/video quality, etc).

Just focus on the fact that you're learning and improving. When you get more experience, it's sensible to start reading other people's code but try and view it objectively.

Don't fixate too much on which tools to use; most programming languages are pretty similar and after using a couple it will get pretty easy to pick up a new one. I currently specialise in Android development but I took a pretty roundabout route to get there (I played around with Python, Java, Unity (C#) and UE4 (C++) first).

See if you can think of a goal and split it up into smaller goals. If your goal is to write Android apps (perhaps not the best way to start), then slowly build up by making small apps and gradually build up to larger projects (there are plenty of apps to copy for practice). 

Try and solve problems on your own if possible, but don't be afraid of Google. Programmers use it very often, especially when learning a new language or framework. As long as you understand whatever code you're copying, it's fine. 

As for the specifics of getting started, I used Sololearn to learn language syntax ([here is the C# tutorial](",4

First off, Germany has a higher minimum wage than the U.S., and higher average gross monthly income (though a lower average net income). It's not like they can't afford higher end phones, and the person you replied to even said ""higher end Samsung's"".

Second, your comment is written as though flagship Samsung phones are cheap. The most expensive S10 variant (S10+, Ceramic, 1TB, $2,210 CAD) is more expensive than the most expensive iPhone Xs variant (Xs Max, 512GB, $2,000 CAD). The cheapest S10 variant (S10e, 128GB, $1,020 CAD) is only $10 cheaper than the current cheapest iPhone (Xr, 64GB, $1,030 CAD). Flagship Android phones are extremely comparable in price to iPhone, so your point really doesn't hold up.

To your point though, iPhones don't succeed simply because people can afford it. It's about the brand, and that breaks down into two parts. First, Apple has largely earned a reputation (that arguably has been damaged in recent years) for being the go-to tech company for people who just need a product that works well. The Mac (specifically, the MacBook Air) very much used to be that, and for many people still is. The iPhone certainly still holds that crown, too. Apple has also done an excellent job of making an ecosystem of products that work seamlessly together. Second, there's brand loyalty, something which you see far more often with a company like Apple than really any Android manufacturer.

iPhone's aren't bad by any means, don't get me wrong, but they don't have such a commanding lead in the U.S. because they're leaps and bounds ahead of the competition (they aren't). They have a commanding lead because of the brand they've built.

Sadly, as of Android Q Beta 2, Solid Explorer and pretty much every other file manager is broken, possibly permanently.  You won't see this if you've upgraded directly from Beta 1 or Pie, as they sort of grandfather in the permissions to see the filesystem.  If you do as I did and wipe your phone, you cannot re-enable the permissions and you're stuck seeing no filesystem.  Even uninstalling and reinstalling Solid Explorer loses the permissions for good.  I've installed 5 or 6 other file managers and they're all broken to some degree.  Some can see most of the folders on the storage but none can get to the files within.  Right now, only the Files that was preinstalled with Android Q and the other Files (beta) from the Play Store (different apps, same name) can see something that so far looks like the whole file system and its contents.  I'd prefer to stay with Solid Explorer but without reverting to Pie, setting up, and then re-upgrading to Beta 2, I can't get the permissions back and Solid Explorer is just not at all an option.  I didn't have any choice in doing a wipe.  After the upgrade to Beta 2, something was running out of control in the background, causing the device to be super choppy all the time even right after rebooting, and the battery was draining really fast -- like from 100% to zero in 4-5 hours even without use.  That didn't happen with Beta 1, and clean installing did fix it.  I never was able to figure out what didn't migrate over properly before that was causing it, but it wasn't showing up in any of the battery activity logs.



So the big question is whether the option to request the same file system permissions that are available to ""Files"" (built in) or ""Files"" (Play Store beta) will also be available to other file managers, because if not, that will mean end of the road for third party file managers.",6

It will require a little more hands on, since there are so many options for customization, but even without all that, it may be just what you have been looking for. With Android you can install third party apps that are not in the 'app store' with a simple toggle of 'allow apps from unknown sources' turned on. This is so nice and something that Apple should have implemented for their users years ago.

They're both great phones but I find myself using the iPhone more, mostly because I've got more paid apps in the iOS ecosystem than Android, also because a lot of the media-creation apps that I use are more mature for iOS than Android. 

I do believe, however, that Android is the technically superior OS and I have a lot more fun using my Pixel than I do my iPhone.

If you're heavily in the Apple ecosystem, for example, Macs instead of PCs, you will miss the ability to easily airdrop photos between phones/computer. I'd suggest getting Pushbullet (for photos) and Dropbox (for videos) for both devices to help facilitate this. It's still a bit of a pain but it works.

Other than that, just be ready to re-purchase your apps on Android and get used to apps using the system's navigation bar to go back a screen instead of everything having its own UI. That's kinda nice tbh, it's a more unifying user experience.

And of course the camera puts the iPhone to shame, especially Night Sight. I've tried taking photos with both iPhone and Pixel side-by-side, the pixel catches a decent pic with Night Sight while the iPhone just gets a black screen.

The call screening feature is also a game-changer, and that's not available on iPhone. 

I'd say to give it a try, force yourself to use it for a full 3/4 of your return window and then if you don't like it return it.

Edit: Also forgot iMessage. No question, Apple has the superior messaging experience. This may not matter to you if you're outside the U.S., as SMS/iMessage seems to be the predominant way to message here but not elsewhere. If you're anywhere else in the world it's Whatsapp, Telegram or Facebook Messenger. But if you're in the states, you WILL miss how iMessage ""just works,"" and you'll also have to make sure you [Deregister iMessage](",4

Price, GUI and proprietary hardware and software.

By now, most of my issues with proprietary shit has probably been resolved. I remember when it was a pain in the ass to get apple products to work with non apple stuff, and it was frustrating. It always drove me nuts that I needed iTunes to load anything onto it, and iTunes needed an account, and a credit card and I said to hell with it when I looked at android phones that worked just as well for much less money, and I didnt need any special software to load music and do what I wanted with it.
When I was younger I used to like modding my phones because I could extend the life of my phone with open source software. Tried doing it with an ipod touch and it worked, but it was much harder than android ever was to accomplish the same thing.
On the same note of open source software.. I use ubuntu on my primary machines and last time I'd looked into it (several years ago now) iPhones were not officially supported. You needed to try several different programs to try to get it to connect to the phone (aslong as it wasnt the newest as no one had cracked how to connect to them yet)and then it still may not work. Yet with android, I didnt need any software or anything, it operates like a USB drive on linux like it does on all platforms.

So, in my experience android has just been easier to work with, and now I've been using it for about 10 years and see no benefit to switching now.
Also, it's always bugged me what apple did to older devices with new updates.

Edit: I'd also never call myself diehard. If a viable alternative to the current mobile OS' comes out that's either cheaper or more efficient for my needs I'd switch ASAP. Brand loyalty gets you nothing in my mind. For now, android is the only one that's proven worth my while though.",1

* It took them ages to implement some kind of multiwindow/multitasking functionality, and even then they've only enabled it on tablets. Samsung has had it since the Galaxy S3. Android proper has had it since 7.0. 6.0 if you count its experimental phase. The S3's multiwindow update came out in 2013. Apple introduced it in iOS 11 (2018), by which time it was already a default Android feature. And Apple still allows it only on tablets.

I’d have to say while I appreciate the simplicity and “it just works” attitude with Apple products in most respects, it seems to be accomplished by locking down/outright denying certain usability features I never realised I relied on so much until after I switched, and in some situations seems to make certain processes more complicated if you want to do something “out of the norm”, and it kind of just backfires in a way.

For one example of many: the Music app. I miss the ability to just drag and drop music files onto my phone with Windows Explorer. Instead, you have to use iTunes to “sync” your music library to your phone, i.e. the “Apple” way. And forget about .FLAC files being simple. iTunes won’t even add acknowledge the existence of .FLAC files if you try to add them to your library. You’ll either have to convert them to .ALAC lossless, or create a second .M4A copy specifically for iTunes.

TL;DR: In the process of trying to simplify the usage of it’s products, Apple has inadvertently complicated or made impossible the ability to do things considered “out of the norm” or niche. Given the choice, I’d go back to Android in a heartbeat.",4

There are cheaper Android phones with good screens and cameras, like OnePlus and Xiaomi. But the very cheapest ones won't even support LTE in the USA. So you go up in budget. And then you want LTE coverage in foreign countries at least as good as what the old iPhone I have (the 6+) has. By then you're within a few hundred dollars of an iPhone XR.

There's always Gismo's LOS13 with his focus on security and providing us with patches and updates both in ROM and kernel side as they become available.

The one metric airpods are much better for is call quality. People sound fine on your end but the sound quality of your voice is so bad I don't take calls on the buds. This is really annoying since I used my airpods constantly for calls.

Also it is just a preference thing, but the ambient sound coming into your ears is both a downside, and a feature of the airpods.

I left Google because their customer support sucks ass. 

You are straight retarded if you think that any iPhone camera comes anywhere near the Pixel, especially in semi low light situations. I am so let down by the Iphones garbage sensor. It’s ridiculous how grainy the iPhone pictures are outside of outdoor, midday shots. 

The Pixel was as buttery smooth as any iPhone. 

Face ID is nice, but adds significant cost to the phone. It also isn’t perfect and is slower. 

The audio quality difference is negligible, but I will concede that Apple does it better. 

The battery life on both phones is phenomenal.

Having said all of that, I really prefer the android experience, outside of iMessage (which is FARRRRR superior).  I dislike How Apple price gouges the fuck out of its users, although android is starting to follow suit. In order to really appreciate Apple, you must purchase a $200 Apple TV, a $1000 iPad Pro, a $2000 MacBook, $170 AirPods, and a $1000 phone. Without the ecosystem, Apple is pretty meh.

Funny that entire services these days are required by law to release their data on you in multiple formats that are easily processable by common software and that are hence transportable, but when you store say a personal diary in an app on Android with most OEMs you'd be hoping the app developer has bothered to integrate a solid backup mechanism. And yes, we can check if they do before storing valuable data in there, at least with apps that aren't niche and have alternatives to them.

But tell that to tech illiterates or simply just novices who may know some stuff about tech but outright not expect backing up to be such a hot mess, especially when the system regularly makes it seem like your device is secure and safely backed up. Hey, good times, eh?! No? What?

Like even my friends who are diehard Android users think that the Samsung Galaxy Tablet is horrible, and they’d rather use an iPad. Like some apps just crash randomly on the Tablet, and it didn’t have all the good exclusives the Samsung phones had.

So I was tired of using the Samsung Galaxy, so I asked my parents to buy an iPhone 6s that was like $400(it was delivered to my house). And I’ve had a better experience with the iPhone than the Tablet. Like the main reason I wanted the iPad was because everyone I knew had an iPad(especially in my school where iPads were used for educational purposes) and because of all the cool Apple exclusive they had on the iPad.

My brother in particular faced an issue with battery as he found it to be draining excessively for which he was recommended resetting the settings, network settings and another one just above ’Factory reset’ and turn wifi power saving on, which somewhat solved his issue
Note: I think that the problem shall only persist if you’re making a transfer from your old iPhone. The phone works just about fine for people who started fresh.

One thing he had to pour a humungous amount of efforts in was transferring whatsapp messages as that is ’officially’not possible. We did manage to do it though.

He had his its and buts and he’s the kind of person who never planned on leaving the eco system but since the day he’s made the switch, he hasn’t looked back and only comes across more and more reasons to love that phone as this phone is very customizable.

There are a couple of things I did a fair share of research on, so if you do get the phone you could shoot a text at me so that I could tell you about them

One heads up though, if you plan on making the switch do it with the intention of using it like an android phone but not an iphone.

2. Android Phones usually come with Gapps (Google apps) preloaded. These aren't just the Google apps that you see (Google app, YouTube, Gmail, etc), but also google play services and other framework dependencies that Google apps need. Rooting and uninstalling these won't be enough and might end up just breaking a lot of things. The best method is to flash a custom ROM without Gapps (Gapps are usually flashed along with the ROM, so just skip that step). There are open source alternatives that you can use.

No innovation. Every MacBook and iPhone has been riding the coattails of its original model for years. For a company that sells this image heavily they're churning out the same shit all the time, and usually a step behind Android and windows developers and manufacturers.

I owned strictly Android phones starting with the T-Mobile Galaxy Exhibit 2 4G, an LCD variant of the Galaxy S. I loved it but it’s hardware was slow even at release. I then moved onto AT&T with the Galaxy S3 and went between that and the Nexus 4 for awhile. Also had a Note 3, Galaxy Alpha, Nexus 5, Note 4, Nexus 6P, and an HTC One. In 2016 I got the Galaxy S7 on launch day after getting a new job at a cellphone repair store. (I was 17 at the time)

I had always hated iPhones and posted those memes about “Hey iPhone! Welcome to 2012!” and what not but working in the repair industry really opened my eyes to not only how much more repairable they are but also how much more convenient they are as a teenager. iMessage, FaceTime, a better snapchat client (dumb, but again, i was 17) were indispensable at my age. My Galaxy S7’s battery life deteriorated significantly by February 2017, and I didn’t want to replace the battery myself. I went to AT&T to ask to do a warranty exchange and they basically told me I was crazy. I went on eBay and ordered a 64 GB iPhone 6s for around $350, and everything just seemed to work better. My boss then offered a month later to give me a 128 GB iPhone 7 if I gave him by 64 GB 6s and $100 and I’ve sorta been hooked ever since. I went to the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone X, and now iPhone XS. I did flirt with the Galaxy S8+ for awhile but the battery life wasn’t there for me and snapchat still sucked. I’ve heard it’s improved considerably since then. I’ll never swear off android as it was my first OS love but I’m liking iOS currently. Maybe the Pixel 4 will win me over.",4

Basically it seems people don’t like apple because it’s popular which isn’t an uncommon occurrence as things like fortnite are disliked for the same reason 

This is especially apparent with the galaxy fold as people are giving it praise left right and centre even though it has many flaws like the crease the side notch and the screen that isn’t flush with the rest of the phone (when in tablet mode) where as if apple were to release a phone identical to them at it would be utterly blasted for being lazy and rushed to market and they would be accused of being a dying company yet again

Samsung's S series is basically the Apple of Android phones. They're pretty expensive and definitely high end phones, but you could get a last Gen model which will still be perfectly usable.

There isn't much to compete with the pocophone's price, but if you want to spend a few hundred more, you get get more flagship style phones for relatively cheap. And there's always refurbished if you want to go down that route.

Although it could have just been instagram changing render from in screen screenshot, onto image taken from the camera itself (although not using native API), in much higher resolution than the screen is, and maybe as a cause of either bad implementation or really just bad downsampling algorithm, images look aliased in diagonal edges.

Apple made the same mistake with their airpods, and Samsung gladly came in late and is offering platform agnostic galaxy buds. Airpods wouldve sold even better if they had better Android support (and no, the special BT chip isnt the reason)

Apple shouldnt be limiting its accessories to only the Apple ecosystem, yes, some people would switch to Android because the watch is holding them to IOS, but far more Android users would buy an Apple Watch and dabble in the Apple accessory ecosystem if Apple supported it.

Apple does make some great products, but they need to stop drinking their own koolaide and start looking at Android users as potential partial customers. ",4

* So it is possible to use a windows or linux machine, and run macOS in a virtual machine, though this is rather difficult (especially to get iMessage working), and can result in your apple ID gettings banned if you're not careful. I have thought of the possibility of hosting physical Macs that users could rent, but pricewise this may not be feasible. So not very likely either way. 
* I am from America haha, and yes i've heard in almost every country other than America, iMessage really isn't that much of a big deal, unfortunately in America we don't have this luxury. Some iOS users will refuse to use anything other than iMessage, and in extreme cases, shun android users or users with ""Green Bubbles"" , this is especially evident in dating apps and such. Especially group chats, some iOS users in the states will swear by iMessages groupchats, at least from what i've seen. 
* In general no, it is fairly easy to make an Android app, aside from its hiccups here and there, its fairly straight forward. If you already know some Java then you already have a decent head start, in terms of the front end, Android apps rely on CSS, and a layout editor/manager, which I find a little easier than HTML/CSS (Which the syncMessage macOS app is written in). The one thing that annoys me with android development is version support, a lot of the nicer new features require a newer version of android so most users don't get to benefit from it, I hope google fixes this soon.

The phone will be more designed to showcase new google features (which again will all trickle down to the other android phones).

* Android has a file manager that is exactly like you'd expect on a computer. I know that for many people that doesn't matter, but it's really nice to have.

Most obvious way would be to start treating Android like something like Windows. You dont need a whole new version every friggin year. Forcing hardware companies to keep up with a software company isnt a solution, and will result in half-assed, bug-ridden versions, which is just bad for user experience . OEMs take a lot more risks and have a lot more costs/benefits to think about when investing to adapt a new version every year, for every device. And they need their own look and feel to the OS in order to distinguish them selves to keep selling phones, so adopting 'clean' android isnt a solution either (and even a clean verison needs to be adapted for specific devices, drivers, etc). 

And frankly, most customers dont give a damn about updates, or even simply dont want them. The need is solely created by google to ship a new OS every year.",4

It was cooked up by the Google+ team as a way to combine all of Google's other messaging services into a single app. When Plus started its death spiral, Hangouts didn't have an obvious home in another division at Google. Eventually, the standalone messaging team was created, but it seemed more interested in starting its own (numerous) projects than supporting a messaging app created by someone else.

&gt;Google Play Music is dying due to pretty much the same situation as Hangouts. Back in 2011, iOS had a great music solution (iTunes), while Android didn't. So Google Music was created by the Android team as part of the ""Android Market"" content store. With Web clients and plans to branch out onto iOS, the ""Android Market"" branding didn't make a ton of sense, so eventually the ""Google Play"" brand was born, and eventually Google Play became separate from the Android division. Now we have Google's YouTube taking over a lot of Google's media content strategy with all new apps, and just like Hangouts, it seems like a solid product is dying due to ""not invented here"" syndrome.

I use both of these apps regularly, and once they are gone, I'm not replacing them with a Google product.  I've had a music family plan for a few years now, but YouTube music is terrible and Spotify is not.

I only have one other thought: Surely there's some alternative settings app? These were all over the Jailbreak app store in the early iOS days, and it surprises me that we couldn't just install some alternative (or maybe a stock app) to change the settings that are currently unavailable.

Phones are one of the most (ab)used tech devices in modern times for that is the nature of the tech, so the Fold (or similar device) has to be more robust.

If I were using such a device, aside from the occasional phone calls, my main use would be to read and watch media.

Android's got its own problems, but it's more compatible, more flexible, tends to get new software features a generation or two before Apple, and also a lot cheaper.  Plus there's a lot more variety, so you can get whatever hardware features are important to you (long-lasting battery, traditional 3.5mm earphone port and compatible USB port, for example) at various price points.  Android's main drawbacks are the fragmented upstream (Android, OEM, and carriers) not coordinating on updates and some OS-level security issues which they've been working on but could still improve.  Apple has its own problems with upgrades degrading older phones, but they do have better security.

BxActions is also fantastic for using the Bixby button as an all-in-one play/pause button, flashlight button, one hand mode button, and switch to last app button.

Other than some software type complaints, this phone is incredible. The camera is amazing with Night Sight and the ability to pick from multiple shots. The battery life is awesome. Fingerprint scanner on rear rocks. I have had zero issues at all I can really think of with this phone. Definitely recommend. I have it on GoogleFi, so I have the total Google experience going. ",4

Phone records can be avoided by using a third party app (preferably an EU based org as they tend to be better at protecting privacy) to make calls and send messages.

Alternatively if it’s not urgent use physical postal mail services and hand write it, if your that concerned for any reason.

Turn location services off if you want that private, after all companies only store what they have, and just turn it on as needed for maps or whatever else.

Sleep on streets and parking lots, you'll have to be stealth in your van though and manage bathroom usage at your gym accordingly.



**Hygiene**

$80 - 1 month of 24-hour gym membership plus whatever BS activation fee they may charge. Shower there and use the restroom when you need. Don't work out too hard. You'll require more calories and you'll sweat more in your clothes, requiring you to use the laundromat.

Step 1 is to unlock your bootloader. This will totally wipe your phone, so be prepared for that. If that is too much for you then I say don't do it. It's hard to brick a Pixel. Usually you can always recover from something going wrong.

They're buying a system they prefer but can only get from one manufacturer. If iOS devices got made by more than one manufacturer, prices would fall. Simple as that. 

Also, obsolescence isn't a big issue on iOS because devices are supported for years and years - historically longer than Android devices. Someone doesn't have to worry about buying an older iOS device. My iPhone 7 runs as fast as day 1 and it'll be 3 years old this year. It will also get updates for probably another 2+ years, immediately and directly from Apple. 

I get it, there's a lot of animosity towards iPhone users in the Android community, but these are the real reasons.

Which is also why dual SIM phones were popular in some markets, it was cheaper to have separate plans and Sims for traditional phone service and data service.

Whatsapp was one of, if not THE, first mass market messaging apps that used data instead of sms. It meant being able to message people for a lot less than what SMS would cost outside the US market, so it stuck.

This is what Google tried to do with Allo, but they were about 5 years too late.

They can provide quick access to portable UI like notes or translations, and can be visual reminders of tasks too.  
&gt;  
&gt;We've built bubbles on top of Android's notification system to provide a familiar and easy to use API for developers.

Where on earth do you get that from?

That would only make sense if Apple were the default option. But it clearly isn't. 
Yes apple is a huge company. But Android and Microsoft are still vastly more popular, to the point that you can absolutely classify them as the default option.

Yes, for many people the deciding factor is the price difference. But for just as many it is the fact that Android is more customizable. Or the prefer the UI. Or so many other reasons.

Only a tiny minority of consumers makes a conscious decision *not* to buy a product. People decide to buy a phone they like, not to not buy the phone they dislike.

There is also nothing unique about Android. Unlike Apple it's nit even a statussymbol.

However yes, the people who dislike apple because of it's popularity do exist. I know I started out that way as an edgy 15 year old.

YT (and even more so TIktok) have a child serialization problem. I can see why their algorithm is really aggressive towards such uploads. The algo isn't perfect so it assumes the worst if a video registers positive for both young kids and nudity.                                  

It is also hard to develop algorithms to detect child porn because no one is going to give you data needed to build models for it (thank god).

If the apple OS was licensed to other manufacturers, then maybe I would have tried it...but when the hardware is only done by Apple, and they want $500-$1000 per phone, no thank you.  Maybe I just want a $300 phone?  Plus, I was not a fan of how Apple used to only be available on certain cellular platforms in the beginning.  I am happy with my $32 walmart/tmobile plan.  Not interested in paying $90-$120 plans with other carriers, when I literally only need the 3GB data plan.",2

I main the S10+, iPhone XS Max, and Gemini PDA right now.  IF you're deep in the apple software ecosystem (iCloud, iMessage, apple pda apps, iPhoto) its gonna be painful.  iMessage can be somewhat used still if you have a Mac, via airmessage for android, and supports all features except the iMessage plugins (games, stickers, and text animations).  google Photos is probably superior to iPhoto in terms of functionality, however you gotta give googs your data.  The PIM apps are easily replaced, but its a pita if you're heavily into using notes sync, or collaborate with pages, numbers,etc.  



Honestly, there's a LOT to really like on the other side, things that you're probably only barely seeing get fleshed out in iOS now that have been pretty mature in android for Half a decade.  If those things don't matter to you though...it might not be for you.  If you can afford to buy the S10 first, why don't you give it a trial run before ""switching"".  If not, you gotta decide if its worth rolling the dice.",6

And before someone says ""android fanboy"", it's not about their products or pricing (that's a different story), it's really their business practices. Mostly things like phones having major issues which get ignored for too long (if they're ever acknowledged) and things like how they reported a ""loss in sales"" because they were forced to sell the battery replacements for $29.

Personally I buy LG because I had an LG G4 that had a known issue with the memory chip. I bought it off ebay, well outside of its warranty, but LG still fixed/replaced my phone at no charge.

With Apple? Better hope it's in warranty or kick rocks.

Also PSA: Don't go to your carrier with cell phone problems, 99% will just say you need to buy a new phone",4

Yes. How many do monthly security updates? Zero. How many outside of Fossil Group do at least quarterly? I don't know of any, but I'm sure someone does. Certainly not LG, if my LG Style was any indication.

&gt; Google has been backpedaling on version 2.0 for over a year with barely any news of the new update. 

Wait, what ""version 2"" are you talking about? WearOS 2.x came out a long time ago. I'm currently on WearOS 2.6. As for the underlying Android version, we're on ""H"" which is Android Pie (9.x). We're caught up to mainline for now (though we typically get the base OS ~6 months after phones). So, Android Q for phones should be August-October, and for watches will be February-April based on prior trends.",4

Literally the last reason I bought a smartwatch.

&gt;	Fitness bands make sense to a degree. And wanting notifications does too.


Fitness and freedom from having to carry my phone while I workout without having to worry about missing anything important ever is why I own one. I can tell you’ve never tried it. The detailed information from my workouts and runs that gets autosynced to the health app on my phone without a single input from me being necessary is worth the price tag alone, everything else is a bonus. 


&gt;	I can actually believe that they will stop being a category like tablets have gone.

Just because android tablets are hot garbage doesn’t mean the iPad still doesn’t sell. Apple sold nearly 10 million of them in Q4 alone last year. The surface also quite well. It’s literally just android tablets that have “Stopped being a category” if they ever even were one with the 0 support they received from their creators.

Talk with anyone that has worked on phone shops and they'll they you this. Most people care about the brand and if the phone does ""x"" well. Sure, they don't want a slow phone, but if it's fast enough (and most mid range SoCs are good enough) they go home happy.

Developping a 3rd-party OS means reverse-engineering the hardware so you can control it, and this requires a lot of hard work just to have it run on one model of phone (and, eg., a Samsung Galaxy s4 1905 might be different than a Samsung Galaxy s4 1915, so the one model isn't actually a big number of phones).

And manufacturers are getting better at locking their hardware away, and there is more models than ever and a higher turnover also, so free software can't keep up unfortunately.

So fuck manufacturers, and support any type of [open hardware](",4
