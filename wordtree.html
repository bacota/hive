DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN 'AS-IS' BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER. Statement of Purpose The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an 'owner') of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a 'Work'). Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ('Commons') that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the 'Affirmer'), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ('Copyright and Related Rights'). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof. 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'Waiver'). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'License'). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 4. Limitations and Disclaimers. a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holders> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

      sText = "Response Second segment First segment Im not typically a person who purchases extended warranties but I have in the past. I dont organize the info in a specific way and I have no idea when anything expires. Tech frustration: my printer doesnt like me. I try printing wirelessly, through a usb connection, through the HP app...nothing works well. And when I finally do get it to print something from a pc or phone Im always out of ink. Of all the technology in my house, this printer consistently fails me and its annoying whenever I have to print. Love technology: I was at a resort this past weekend with other family members and didnt know the area. A combination of google maps, Waze, yelp, open table and weather helped make the weekend less stressful on everyone. Loved my phone and being able to find solutions in real time. Online upgrades part 2 Online upgrades part1 My friends passed off a Amazon dot to us on Tuesday. I set it up in the bathroom for shower music. Echo devices are supposed to be able to syce music together for whole house audio. Apparently this does not work with Bluetooth speakers connected, so in my case, none of my speakers will sync. Grrrr, minus 3 points for Amazon. Wireless printing is amazing! To be able to work on my resume on Google docs (on any device) and cloud print via wifi is super handy. Score one for technology. I started keeping boxes when I bought my home and started outfitting it. It quickly got overwhelming. Then I stopped keeping them all and started just keeping boxes for expensive things or things I felt would break at some point (ie cell phones, printers, headphones), eventually that became overwhelming. I now try to hold on the the boxes for a month or less, then just the paperwork if it seems worthwhile. I know what you are thinking. Well maybe. My guess is either wow thats a lot of dust, which I agree with. Or, so is it worth it to save them? 98% of the time no. The product either works fine, or at least works fine I till the warranty expires. Even in the case it breaks while the warranty is in force, I have found the internet is the best way to find the information and contact the company, then they dont usually even want you to sent the box. As I write this I realize how futile it is to save this stuff. Maybe I should just start taking pictures of the stuff that matters and save it in its own album online.... Then after the research at Apple.com I would go to the Verizon store to price out what an upgrade would cost especially since the features between the 3 are so similar. 'One thing that frustrates me about technology is when you really need it to work and it acts up. For instance as you can see above I have 3 emails on my Office 365 app - my school, my work, and my boss. I can also see all the calendars merged into one. The one problem with this is that, like today, if my boss changes his password for some reason it kicks me off all my emails until I put in the new password. My other option is deleting his account and then adding it after I talk to him. Another issue I have been having is that I cannot see two of the other attorneys calendars which I could before when I was a clerk. To remedy this we had to put a call into the people that do IT for the whole firm bc they are familiar with network permissions.'This picture depicts everything I hate about technology. Im a part time server still and this is an image I see in reality at least 5 times a weekend. People are so caught up in technology that they dont really interact with people anymore. Because I observe this a the time I try to set rules when my friends or family go out to dinner...no phones! One thing I love about technology today is how everything is connected wirelessly through Bluetooth and the internet. I love that I can listen to my music while stuck in rush hour traffic and switch stations on voice command. The iPhone just had an update that allows Siri to interact with Pandora and Siri can be accessed through my car via Bluetooth. Having all my favorite tunes comes in clutch for the hour commute each way to work usually in rush hour. I hate technology - I was playing Xbox the other day and the controller died. I didnt have any fresh AA batteries so I had to go scour the house for something to borrow them from. Also the remote for my soundbar is dead and I cant get the little door open to access the batteries. Lithium batteries are starting to feel so old fashioned and annoying. Looking for a new TV you had some trouble with our printer this week, called tech support but did not have any success. Ordered a new printer on eBay 😑 Sunday pre game, enjoying Sunday football on our TV... favorite day of the week! Boxes, manuals Shopping My ever growing book of passwords! I hate technology for the constant changing of passwords! It seems I never have the correct one. I have tried Vaults and other Keeper apps but when the time comes for the password I find myself having to constantly reset as I have forgotten the current password. I love technology! 14 hours of audio book on audible in the car on a road trip this weekend! Made the time fly!! Sorry Im not really a saver. I look everything up on the internet.

Would consider a warranty, but usually dont but them. Just want standard features, nothing special at a decent affordable price. Random This is a photo of my piece of crap blue ray player that stopped working last night resulting in me not watching a movie resulting in me being charged another night at redbox. Lol.

Shopping for a laptop upgrade Warranties 'Why do I hate technology? Memory is never big enough!'Why do I love technology? Because Im able to take pictures and share them immediately with friends and familia. Me in the store. You can see the excitement in my eyes. This is the model Id buy (and almost did). You can see all the specs and I would also add on the Apple Care - well worth the $99 in my humble opinion. Im very familiar with the iPad and didnt need to ask for help. I do like the Retina display and the ProMotion technology but have no idea what that is or how it works but it looks damn cool! Going through the various options. I have a budget in mind so I narrow it down to the 10.5 w/ 64GB. This would be my 3rd iPad so Im pretty familiar with options and what I like/want. Thats the one but I wouldnt buy the stylus, waaay overpriced Heres the iPad Im looking at - 2nd from left, the 10.5 model. Walking into the Apple store to purchase an iPad. 'Technology Love - I love that I can set the alarm on my Apple Watch and it wont wake up my wife. Because the alarm is actually a vibration, you dont have to wake up to an audible alarm. Definitely more pleasant that way.'Technology Frustration - Apple chargers do not hold up well. The cable easily gets nicks/splits and exposes the wiring. One of the few knocks against Apple. 'Two Factor Authentication I love the ease of TFA between my devices. I can access these via both my phone and watch. Although not pictured, the TFAs come to my watch also.''Two Factor Authentication Computer screen shot'Boxes - Video 1 Love technology! My study group decided to take a quiz later today, but I havent seen the lectures yet. Ill was out at the park and then a baby shower, so I didnt have the ability to sit down at a computer to watch. Luckily I can access the class on my phone through the schools app! I was able to watch the lecture, and plan on taking the quiz later when I get home. I hate technology. My automatic light dimmer and timer has not been functioning with the app on my phone. With products like this, there doesnt seem to be a lot of tech support. I have to shut the whole tanks electric power system down, and restart it so I can try to connect to the Bluetooth on the lights. Now its 270 dollars gone bc there is no warranty offered on it 'The reason I upgraded iPhone was bc its water resistant We upgraded sound system bc it has the imax quality He is in charge of that part'I dont know if this really qualifies as an ‘I hate technology ‘ post, but...we have zero choice here in our neighborhood for internet providers. Comcast owns us and they are well aware. Our bill for internet is $112 a month, our service is sketchy at best and I work from home about 15 hours a week. If I try to post or upload anything I have to walk out to the room that has the Xfinity/Comcast device to complete whatever I am trying to do. Very frustrating. I wish there was some competition around here because I think our quality and service would greatly improve. Frustration! We are on a mini vacation/some work too. We decided to drive to Taos and the Internet is barely usable anywhere. Which is fine, its good to unplug but I am so dependent on using it for directions! Also, I rarely keep warranty cards, etc...because the Verizon store, Costco, the places we usually buy our electronics keep records of purchases so I dont have to. Tv shopping on line Love technology! Get Upside is a new app that gives money back on gas purchases at gas station you pick from app. Locked out of account. Trying to help my son complete his new hire paperwork. He tried guessing his password to many times before opting to choose forgot password.

Tech support contacted me and I started getting a different error message to I did the best I could holding the phone and recording with it. Hello, I am trying to work on this task and I am getting this error message. How can I get around this? I dont have anything else open. Thanks for any advise you can give I recorded a video of my process to look for a new laptop for my daughter. Video seemed easier than screen capture and honestly I would not typically do a lot of research on my phone. Too small and the browsers arent as easy to work in. This is my nightmare. It requires at least two remotes to turn on anything because the universal remote controls volume but no other features if the receiver. Add in that I accidentally hit the off button instead of the on button on said universal remote...it took three remotes to get my DirectTV on so I could record a show 😒 I did in fact try to use the app on my phone instead, which should be much quicker. But for some reason the app would.not.load. So apparently this TV and receiver talk to each other and I dont have to tell the receiver which source is playing sound! Who knew? And a lifesaver when trying to start the dvd for my 4 nieces and nephew, all under the age of 10. Patience is not their virtue Shopping for a laptop Frustrated will the technology.

Boxes 'Technology Frustration AND Technology Love (over the same issue): for the last task tonight (Upgrades) I got carried away with shopping and my second video was too long. First, I uploaded it anyway hoping Indeemo would just cut it off at 10 minutes but the Indeemo screen was just black after the upload. So I canceled it and googled how to edit the video down to under 10 minutes. At first I thought I would have to do the whole thing again and it would be much less spontaneous. So I was super happy when I finally figured out how to trim and save. Yay me.''Upgrading Versions Part 2: Scoping out HDTV smart TV upgrade. Sorry, it was too long so I trimmed the last 27 seconds! All youre missing is my endless rant about a warranty term. Also, Im adding this task to my diary of frustrating tech moments because I didnt know how to trim 😬'Upgrading Versions: Part 1, Desktop PC TV upgrade This wireless remote technology saved my day. We had my in-laws over for dinner Sunday and I had to have a brisket smoked and ready to eat on time. To get that done I had to start the brisket on the smoker at midnight. If you have never smoked a brisket it takes a lot of attention to cook it probably. The remote devise was on my night stand and sound the alarm when the meat reached a programmed temperature. The other end of this devise was in the meat and it operates up to 300 ft. I was up at 130 and 430 to care for the brisket. Without this devise I would not been able to smoke the brisket overnight without staying up all night. This devise saved the day.
